<p>The 20 months old Syrian uprising has by now turned into a full out civil war according to most estimates. Bashar El Assad’s brutal repression of any opposition has not only radicalized the rebel movements opposing him but it also turned what was originally a fight for freedom and democracy into a sectarian struggle.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Assad clan has over the years built its regime around the Alawite community (10% of the population) from which it originates, as well as a significant proportion of the Druze and Christian minorities (3% and 10% of the population respectively) at the expense of the Sunni majority.</p>
<p>Today most members of the armed forces and of the government are Alawites and they know that if they fail on maintaining power, the survival of their community in Syria is seriously threatened. Hence, many analysts are today claiming that El Assad is gearing up for a last chance scenario in which he would retreat into the Alawite heartland in order to establish an independent country for his community there.</p>

<p>This region located on the coast and home to a harbour, a Russian military base and separated from the rest of Syria by mountains could be a viable option for the survival of the regime. As such, it has been reported that Alawite militias have already started expelling Sunni inhabitants of the area.</p>
