<p>Amiens-Nord, last Monday night. About one hundred youngsters confront French police after a routine check of a reckless driver. During a night of violence, sixteen policemen were injured and a school and a youth centre partially burned. Sounds familiar? Of course it does. Everyone will recall the images of the London riots last year. Or the pictures of the 9.000 vehicles burned during two weeks of upheaval across France in 2005.</p>
<p>So what do we make of these events? Are they consequences of a failed immigration policy?  Of a crippled economy and the new austerity measures? Of an outdated education system? Or are they simply a sign of our time?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The recurring aspect about these riots is that nobody seems to have the answer to these questions.</p>
<p>The UK troubles are the best example of this. In remembrance of their first anniversary, the BBC provided all sorts of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/uk-18681866">facts</a> about the looting and its consequences. One important conclusion was that the British judiciary could be proud of the firm hand it has shown: 1.292 culprits were sent to prison, amassing to an impressive <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/uk-england-london-19111720">1.800 years</a> of punishment.</p>
<p>But concerning the underlying causes, no real answers have been given. Over a quarter of the prosecuted London rioters were juveniles. So this indicates a problem with their education. Or their parental situation. Or their desperate need for Wii game consoles. Figures concerning ethnicity show that only 29% of the convicts were ‘white’. So this suggests that immigration might be a problem. Or the integration of immigrants. Or maybe a justice system that is biased towards the ‘black’ criminal. Or simply the fact that UK media-consumers find this an interesting way to categorize people. Among the convicted were both gang members and Harry Potter-actors. Try to make something of that when assessing social background and economic situation.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/uk-19156183">Mark Easton</a> recently wrote: the riots ‘were out of character’. But not because ‘Britain doesn’t behave like that’, but simply because they do not fit with our understanding of why people commit such violence. Events like those in Amiens are indeed a relatively new phenomenon. But they also indicate something else that is new: there are things going on in society we can no longer explain.</p>
<p>It has been a while, but an old and nearly forgotten sentence reappears: we do not know. At least that we know.</p>
