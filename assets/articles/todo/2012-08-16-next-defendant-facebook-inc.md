<p>Finally, Google has joined the war on piracy. <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/watch?v=ZVoFymy3IMU" target="_blank">*Cue background music*</a></p>
<p>Online piracy, that is; apologies to readers who were already picturing Eric Schmidt and Larry Page on a gunboat in the Gulf of Aden. No, unfortunately. What they're actually doing is much less adventurous, and slightly more dubious. Earlier this week Google spokespeople communicated that they had started pushing down "pirate sites" in their search results. They don't seem to be very proud of it though: the silence on the subject on their <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/press" target="_blank">official blog</a> is telling. But proud or not, the obvious problem remains: Google Inc. — an unchecked private company — has named itself judge, jury, and executioner in the case of internet piracy. So no one should be surprised that pirated content on sister site <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/?source=cnn_bin" target="_blank">Youtube escapes the embargo</a>. Or do you really think the *background music* linked above isn't pirated? And yet, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Picture-2.png" target="_blank">it shows up second</a>, along with three other pirated versions.</p>
<p>But nevermind.</p>
<p>I, for one, welcome our new Google overlords. And to show my loyalty, I will give them the head of one of their sworn enemies. Yes, I am going to prove that Facebook Inc. is nothing but an out-of-control band of buccaneers; that Mark Zuckerberg is worse than Bluebeard, though not quite as awesome:</p>

<p>Small problem is that the meaning of the word "pirate", <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/21552214" target="_blank">like so many other concepts</a>, has inflated over time. Initially it used refer only to seafarers who, instead of engaging in trade, used violence to make a living. Then the term was expanded to illegal radio makers, broadcasting from the sea. From there it got its current meaning of copyright breacher. Luckily, the first and the last type of pirates have two important features in common: (1) they don't produce any added value, and therefore (2) they have to appropriate others' work for their own benefit. I will argue that this description also applies to the activities of Facebook.</p>
<p>So Facebook doesn't produce any added value itself? To prove this assertion, I can call upon nearly 48 million witnesses, a.k.a. the shareholders. Collectively, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/chart" target="_blank">they have been pushing down Facebook's value for nearly three months now</a>. Not an automatic believer in the rationality of the stock markets? Quite rightly so, but <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/What-Causes-Internet-Companies-To-Fail.aspx" target="_blank">this next testimony</a> shows that, in this particular case, there is some truth behind it: instead of producing its own content, Facebook relies on non-paying users to do so, and then sells the whole package to advertisers. Myspace anyone?</p>
<p>And this brings us to point two: the appropriation of others' work. Call <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/youre-getting-facebook-timeline-now-whether-you-like-it-or-not" target="_blank">Exhibit #1</a>! Timeline: last week, the defendant started forcing even the most reluctant users into this new format — a process that's supposed to be completed in November (<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/switch-to-timeline" target="_blank">Exhibit #1b</a>). This feature takes away the possibility to delete any of the added content, and only allows users the option to "hide" things from their timeline.* And so Bluebeard Zuckerberg retains all your valuable information. Even more blatant is the new scheme that allows companies/narcissists to drag more attention to their updates in exchange for a fee (<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/technology-18033259" target="_blank">Exhibit #2</a>). If this practice spreads, the ultimate consequence would be that everyone would have to pay to get noticed: the information society's equivalent to protection money.  And then there's that last pirate movie cliché: the former companion returning for his share of the loot (<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ceglia-sanctioned-again" target="_blank">Exhibit #3</a>).</p>
<p>Put together, Your Honour, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, Mr. Executioner, all this evidence proves that you could rightfully ban Facebook from your search results under the charge of piracy.</p>
<p>I rest my case.</p>

<p>*It has been pointed out to me that this assertion is actually wrong. Read it somewhere and didn't double check. For this I will rightly go to hell.</p>
