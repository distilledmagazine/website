<p>The Afghan endgame has begun. In 2014 the coalition forces will return home, leaving the country’s security to the troops they have been training over the years. On <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/p28134">May 1<sup>st</sup></a> president Obama spoke of ‘a new kind of relationship’ between the United States and Afghanistan, ‘a future in which Afghans are responsible for the security of their nation, and we build an equal partnership between two sovereign states; a future in which war ends, and a new chapter begins’.</p>
<p>One reason why this withdrawal has become necessary are the waves of negative images surrounding the conflict. Besides the regular reports on the rising death toll, recent stories have been about the attacks by ‘allied’ Afghan soldiers and the famous ‘urinating soldiers’ incident. The eleven years of warfare are depicted as highly negative, both for the country itself and the international actors involved. The ‘new chapter’ Obama speaks of is thus portrayed (but not accepted) as a light of hope in the unending Afghan darkness. But is Afghanistan really such a pit of despair?</p>

<p>The<em> Afghanistan Human Development Report </em>of 2007<em> </em>states that between 2002 and 2005 the GDP per capita increased from $683 to $984. The gross enrolment ratio has risen from 45 to 59.3 percent. Over five million children attended school in 2007, compared to only 900.000 five years earlier. In 2008 Afghanistan won its first ever <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/7586149.stm">medal</a> at the Olympics. Initiatives such as starting a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/can-theater-transform-kabul">theatre</a> have become possible. Through cooperation with the UN, 600 students will be able to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=197:afghan-women-leaders-pledge-support-to-regional-network-for-n-peace&amp;catid=37:poverty-reduction&amp;Itemid=53">study</a> in India during the coming years. Especially in the field of gender equality the changes have been important. A recent <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/demography">demographic survey</a> showed that the median age of marriage has risen to 18 and that the use of contraception is rising, especially in rural areas. School attendance for girls remains low, but has clearly improved compared to the Taliban era.</p>
<p>These are only few aspects of a major (positive) change Afghanistan has experienced. Unfortunately, a lot of media commentators remain blind to these other effects of the war. And due to the country’s precarious future, politicians nowadays also prefer to highlight more direct successes of the war. When summing up the achieved results to the American <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/p28136">troops</a> and their <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/p28134">home</a> audience, Obama pointed to the defeat of Al-Qaeda and the increased security for the American homeland, not to what has been achieved for the Afghani people.</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty about the withdrawal, it is however necessary to take these forgotten consequences into account. As in all wars, both sides are moulded by the conflict and cannot claim they haven’t changed. The invasion forces and their aid had a tremendous influence on the country. For the Afghani population this also means that many doors have opened, doors they might not want to see closed again. News that even villagers in conservative areas are increasingly <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/21560606">taking up arms</a> against the strict Taliban rules demonstrate that the clock cannot be turned back.</p>
<p>Despite the ‘grand designs’ being put in place, Afghanistan’s future will not only be decided by international high politics. It will be as much decided by how much the Afghani people have changed, and it is not only the killing that matters in this respect. As the experienced Belgian war correspondent <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/rudi-in-de-vuurlinie">Rudi Vranckx</a> recently stated when spotting a group of schoolgirls in Kabul: ‘This is the real change’. It would be foolish to take it out of the equation.</p>
