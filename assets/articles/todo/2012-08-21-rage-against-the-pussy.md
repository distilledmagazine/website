<p style="text-align: justify;">Let's start with a quick question.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Did anyone actually listen to Pussy Riot? As in <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/pussy-riot-release-new-single-video?intcmp=239" target="_blank">their music</a>, not the news. No one feels to need to dwell on that for a second? Et tu, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/?query=pussy+riot&amp;filters=album_reviews&amp;min_year=1999&amp;max_year=2012" target="_blank">Pitchfork</a>?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Okay, a short review then.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basics first: Pussy Riot is a punk band. Not the kind of pubic punk The Blink-41s brought upon us two decades ago; not the kind of cooked up Sex Pistol controversy that earned Malcolm McLaren a living; <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/podcastfirstversion.jpg" target="_blank">real punk</a>. Musically they owe far more to the hardcore punk tradition of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/watch?v=-KTsXHXMkJA" target="_blank">Dead Kennedys</a>, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/watch?v=qS9B9lLmULE" target="_blank">Black Flag</a>, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/watch?v=H1i9owelB-k" target="_blank">Minor Threat</a>, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">NameDropper</a>, and a load of other bands known for proclaiming themselves not dead. Click on the links, and you'll know what that means: loud, aggressive music. You could say those are just conventions of the genre; but there's always more to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The challenge Pussy Riot's counterparts in the West face is staying relevant. I think the problem is that punk's unmitigated aggression is no longer appealing to a society that's becoming ever less violent. (Does that statement surprise you? Read Stephen Pinker's <em>The Better Angels of our Nature</em>, or at least <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/violence-history" target="_blank">this summary</a>, and watch your scepticism disappear.) This means that aggressive music will only inspire when the energy is aimed at a bigger wrong. There are two obvious ways to respond to this challenge: turning down the volume, or finding that bigger wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My own favourite band has gone the first way. In the 1980s Einstürzende Neubauten was a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/watch?v=7IL__IAyBuE" target="_blank">loud, nihilistic industrial band</a>, based in West-Berlin. But in the early nineties the grim clouds of Cold War and ideological struggle over the city evaporated. Their music subsequently evolved to embrace <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/watch?v=hex6IErt9do" target="_blank">silence and melody</a>. But underneath this quiet exterior, the rebellion went on: they started pioneering a new record funding system as an alternative to the standard music industry, based on <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/BlixaBargeldErinZhu" target="_blank">crowd sourcing through the online community</a>. Speak softly and carry a big stick.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some bands kept shouting loudly though. Rage Against The Machine — in the news recently for having <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/watch?v=6iljJo0cPFY" target="_blank">a rather questionable new fan</a> — stormed onto the scene in the early nineties combining the rightful indignation of early hip-hop with the raw power of heavy metal. But when the climate changed thoughout the nineties (again, read Steven Pinker if you've got doubts on this) they didn't succeed at staying relevant. From Robin Hoods, they turned into Don Quijotes. So no one should be surprised that a nutcase like Paul Ryan can identify with them, even though he's <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/todd-akin-and-paul-ryan-are-more-alike-than-you-think.html" target="_blank">an extremist from completely the other side</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Back to Russia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The way I see it, it would be extremely unfair to judge Pussy Riot's provocations by the same standards as their Western counterparts, like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/opinion/the-wrong-reasons-to-back-pussy-riot.html" target="_blank">this piece</a> in the New York Times does. This for exactly the reason I named above: the wrongs justify the anger. Their <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/pussy-riot-punk-prayer-lyrics" target="_blank">two main causes</a> could have come straight out of Steven Pinker's book: Humanitarian Revolution against a violent government, and a Rights Revolution against gender oppression. So in the end, their disruptive protests are aiming in the right direction: a more peaceful society. And if aggressive art is the way to do it, this end more than justifies the means.</p>
