<p>Besides an <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/watch?v=sBT3w0JY8dY">unholy alliance with the movie industry</a> (not to mention <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tt0904208">television</a>), <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/davidoff_classic.jpg">this </a>is where most of cigarette advertising has been relegated to...its actual brand, and the box it comes in. With the exception of a few magazines, cigarettes are not to be seen nor heard at the behest of health-campaigners and concerned members of parliament. I’m going to have to interject here — I do not seek to make bedfellows with “big tobacco” (although I’m sure it would be the best marketing internship you could have on your CV); one need only look at the state of cigarette addiction in <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/521224">Indonesia</a> to see why they are a reprehensible bunch. Neither do I feel the need to remove health warning from packaging either, since as I will elaborate on, education has always been a winning strategy.</p>
<p>But back to the news. Australia has recently <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/australian-court-oks-logo-ban-cigarette-packs-17007050#.UC5Q791mTa4">banned branding on cigarette packs</a> - they will all now be the same olive green colour, with plain-font names, and dominated by even larger pictures of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/www.thedoctorstv.com">medical porn</a>. The tobacco opposition in <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/australian-court-upholds-law-to-keep-cigarette-packaging-logo-free/article4481809/">Canada</a> is considering doing the same.</p>
<p>I assume this is because there is not enough public information available on the fact that smoking is bad for you. If only people who smoked knew that they were being blinded by flashy packaging into selling their lifespan to corporate profits and their soul to lucifer.</p>

<p>Oh wait, that describes exactly zero per cent of smokers unless you’ve been exposed to nothing but Mad Men your entire life.</p>
<p>No, this is soccer moms patting themselves on the back for distracting themselves from the profound meaninglessness and boredom of their lives. And forgetting that their coffee addiction will probably kill them before second-hand smoke does.</p>
<p>True, if the entire world never smoked we would live longer (as for happier I withhold judgement). But would a smoker not smoke because the packaging was legally mandated to be ugly? I’m by no means a libertarian, but doesn’t the state have anything better to do? If you want to improve public health, how about putting pictures of overweight lonely people on chocolate bars? Subsidising gym membership fees? Paying <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/movie-it-clown-colour-red-size-19369-38191_medium.jpg">clowns</a> to chase after children at recess? surely all of those things could be done for the price of these emotionally masturbatory anti-cigarette initiatives.</p>
<p>A final element that seems to escape the...let’s call them “health-conscious” groups is that you can’t make smoking go away. You can mandate that cigarettes can only be purchased with Reichsmarks on Thursdays and people will still smoke. Why? Because people do these things. There is a culture to it. I’m not saying all people or that they should, but they do... and people will find a way to get them. Have you ever seen illegal cigarettes? They come from Native reserves in plastic bags, and people smoke those. Olive green boxes would be a luxury to anyone whose cigarettes come in a Zip-Loc. You cannot legislate what people do to their bodies ad nauseum like this, and it contributes to the unfortunate attitude that interest groups and legislators know what is best for you. Notice I did not say ‘the government’ whose experts in various fields may well know what is best. Unfortunately they aren’t the ones making these laws.</p>
<p>Awareness and health information has been the strategy for reducing smoking for decades now. And it was working. It’s not so much that I’m opposed to the law but that I think it’s sensationalist and won’t deliver a health return on the investment. Why would we change tactics to attack tobacco marketing anew? I suppose because we had an epiphany that a man who has accepted the fate of his dying breath being through a hole in his trachea can decide to radically alter his life once his Marlboros no longer resemble the F1 car that bears their logo. Which is why, of course, he started in the first place.</p>
