<p>Some weeks just seem to have a global theme. Generally this would be something along the lines of a natural disaster, the start of a conflict, or a big international conference. This week was however a bit different. Instead of one event there were three, each of them seemingly unrelated but still going to the core of modern society. Together they form this week’s story.</p>
<p>The first chapter of the tale belongs to the imposter. His life has been all about victory and conquest. The act he became famous for was crossing the Pyrenees and the Alps, beating Hannibal at his own game. By conquering these mountains seven times in a row, each time defeating the contenders accompanying him, this man showed the world what he was capable of. The hero who had looked death in the eye seemed unbeatable. His fans cheered, not only for his victories but also for his generosity towards the sick. But something seemed wrong; whispers of treachery where heard, the eyes of the spectators started to show doubt. As his enemies one by one confessed to a pact with the devil, how could this man’s extraordinary performances be pure? Friends started to talk and evidence gathered. This week it has been confirmed what everyone already knew: Lance Armstrong was an imposter.</p>
<p>The second chapter is about a servant of the public. A man who believed this world should be free, a world where everyone is entitled to knowledge about their overlords’ behaviour. After he put his views to practice a storm gathered over his head. The high and mighty did not like the revealing of their actions and started to hunt him down like the witches of old. His accomplice was captured and is now, according to his friends, detained and tortured. The defender of free speech himself was accused of other offences and had to flee. This week he found protection in a hideout provided to him by foreign friends. But the charges still stand: could Julian Assange also be a vile rapist?</p>

<p>Finally there is the chapter of the murderer. A cold and hideous creature, this villain followed his dreams about a new world order. He believed that his society was being poisoned by strangers and their domestic supporters, so pretending to be a white knight he went on a well-prepared murderous raid. After distracting the unprepared forces of law with a well timed bombing, he singlehandedly killed 69 young people on a desolate island. The country was struck in the heart.  He did not struggle when apprehended, as he wanted to become a living martyr. This week his punishment was determined: the victims’ families were pleased as he will be in prison for at least 21 years, but as this allows him to play his role into the distant future, Anders Behring Breivik left court as a smiling Joker.</p>
<p>The overarching theme of the Armstrong, Assange and Breivik cases is justice. We live in what is called a R<em>echtsstaat </em>in German, which is often translated as ‘legal state’. But its meanings run deeper, as the word also implies that <em>recht</em> will be done: a decision not only needs to be legal, it needs to be just. Similarly the mentioned cases not only have legal aspects to them, but also carry profound questions about individual and state applications of justice. To some Armstrong will remain a hero persecuted by an overambitious USADA, to others he might be a proud and egocentric athlete failing to come clean with his past. Assange could both be a defender of freedom of speech and an evader of the system of justice. And can we really speak of justice for the victims of Utoya when Breivik walks smilingly towards his three-roomed cell, ready to write the next chapters of his manifesto?</p>
<p>As the final lines of these stories have not yet been written, we can only wait until history does. In the mean time we can do our part by wondering about the thin line between legality and justice. Today I have not provided you with facts; I have started to write a story. It could be your version, it could be mine. But as it is only the beginning, you definitely will have to come up with your own ending to the tale of justice.</p>
