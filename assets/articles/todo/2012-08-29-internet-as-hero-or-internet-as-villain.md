<p style="text-align: justify;">Whatever the political controversy surrounding it, the majority of scientists have now accepted the idea of man-made global warming (<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/science-environment-19047501" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/sci<wbr />ence-environment-19047501</a>). Much attention has turned to "big polluters" such as heavy industry and the airlines. As a result many businesses (sometimes with the encouragement of government) have turned to e-working as a solution. Instead of flying your executives to meetings all over the world, why not take advantage of modern technology and arrange web meetings? Rather than have a large workforce travelling in to a central office, let them work form home, able to connect seamlessly through your virtual private network.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At the same time there has been a seismic shift in business practise with increasing numbers of firms turning to the cloud to serve their business IT needs. Companies such as Amazon (with EC2) and Microsoft (Azure) have built a new industry based on renting out "virtual computers" to anyone that needs them. And companies like DropBox have created a new business in remote, secure, globally accessible cloud storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But all these "virtual" cloud services actually reside on real physical machines, as are the stalwarts of the web such as Google, YouTube and Facebook. These physical machines are kept in massive warehouses known as data centres (or datacenters). The biggest of these warehouses house up to a million servers and can draw 100MW of power. In fact they are such big users of power that some commentators believe they are responsible for as much CO2 emissions as the airline industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Five years ago the US government woke up to this fact and issued an instruction to the EPA Energy Star programme to investigate data centre energy efficiency. Their report [link] identified that not only were these data centres drawing a massive amount of power, they were also throwing more than half of it away through cooling and other inefficiencies. The outcome of this was an initiative called the Green Grid. This produced a simple measure of the efficiency of data centres called PUE (power usage effectiveness). At the time many datacentres came in with a PUE of 2 or above (meaning they were wasting over half their power. Modern data centres have improved markedly, with PUEs of 1.1 or better reflecting an inefficiency of less than 10%.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two years ago people were content to receive iPlayer in standard definition, now they want to get it in HD (requiring 4 times as much data). The same is true for YouTube. And the massive growth of social networking and the need to tweet photos of every experience during your day is also serving to inflate the data delivered across the Internet. And all that data ultimately comes from a data centre somewhere out there in the ether.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The problem is we as a species are really poor at understanding exponential growth. Take the apocryphal story of the Emperor who told the inventor of chess to "Name your reward". The clever inventor duly asked the emperor to give him one grain of rice on the first square of the board, two on the second, four on the third and so on. Ultimately the inventor would have received more rice than has ever existed in the whole world. Exponential growth in the Internet is not quite as bad as this, but roughly speaking the volume of data doubles every two years. So even if every individual data centre reduces its carbon footprint by a third every year, the overall carbon footprint is going to head inexorably (and quickly) upwards. By 2020 we may well be looking at the Internet being responsible for more pollution than any other industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So what is the moral of this tale? Well, put simply, there isn't one. Unless we are able to transform the way the Internet works in the next decade we will be facing an impossible situation. But fear not, because help may be at hand. Already companies such as Facebook have started siting their datacentres to take advantage of renewable energy sources such as hydro-electric power. The drivers for this are predominantly to do with energy security and economics, but it is a welcome step in the right direction. There is also much talk of moving to a distributed model. Much of the hidden energy cost of the Internet lies in the access network connecting your house to the core of the Internet. If one could move the data further out into this access network you could potentially save a significant amount of data. Finally there is the hope that technology may save the day. Future developments in semiconductors hold the promise of more efficient computers, lower energy networks and hence a reduction in the overall carbon footprint of the Internet.</p>
