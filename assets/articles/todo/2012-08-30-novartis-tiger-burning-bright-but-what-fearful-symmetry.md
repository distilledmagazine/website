<p>Today’s trivia: what do 1700 endangered tigers and Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant have in common? Give up?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-273 aligncenter" title="Indian_Tiger_Wayanad" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Indian_Tiger_Wayanad-300x188.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="188" /><img class="size-medium wp-image-274 aligncenter" title="320px-Industria_Novartis" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/320px-Industria_Novartis-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>Well, the answer is probably very little other than that both are crucial items on the docket of the Indian Supreme Court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Before we jump into the legal thicket, it’s first worth noting that there’s a violent ethnic conflict occuring in the northeast part of India that has claimed hundreds of lives and has <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/NAT-TOP-assam-riots-indias-worst-communal-clashes-in-a-decade-3686384-NOR.html">displaced almost 500,000 </a>people from their homes. And a story like that just wouldn’t be complete without referencing the role that social media plays, especially considering that the government has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/world/asia/after-violence-india-cracks-down-on-web-and-texts.html?%20r=1&amp;partner=rssny@emc=rss">restricted internet access</a> following the clash.</p>
<p>But getting back on track, there is unanimous agreement that India’s majestic cats are in big trouble. At the turn of the century 45,000 tigers roamed the country compared a paltry 1700 today. The disagreement among those who want to save the tigers is how best to protect the lifeblood of India’s tourism industry from extinction.</p>
<p>In late July the high court temporarily resolved the matter by issuing an interim order <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/india-supreme-court-bans-tiger-tourism-in-nature-reserves-2012">banning tourists from the ‘core’ zones</a> of the country’s 40+ tiger reserves.</p>
<p>The man who is almost single-handedly responsible for the ban is activist <a href="http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/a-conversation-with-tiger-activist-ajay-dubey/">Ajay Dubey</a>, who insists that mindless tourism is harming the tiger population and wants to see their habitats kept free of human activities.</p>
<p>He also maintains that he only wants to see rule of law adhered to and for the court to strictly enforce the 1972 Wildlife Protection Act, which requires each reserve to contain a core area that is only accessible to forestry officials. Depending on the park, the safeguarded area can stretch as far as 1,000 square kilometers and effectively restricts tourism to areas where tigers are considerably more elusive.</p>
<p>Yet the decision has been widely panned by conservationists who claim that the ban will do more harm than good, and by the tens of thousands of people who rely on the creatures for their livelihood. Both groups claim to be crucial to the continued survival of tigers because forestry officials alone aren’t equipped to legitimately track the cats and deter would-be poachers.</p>
<p>Local governments have also urged that the provisional order be overturned owing to the vast number of people whose employment depends on the tiger tourism industry</p>
<p>For its part though, the judiciary <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/how-the-tourism-ban-affects-india%E2%80%99s-tiger-parks">chastised the government</a> for its lack of earnest action in defending the dwindling tiger population when it extended the temporary measure until August 22, implying that their interest in the cats only extended as far as protecting commercial activities.</p>
<p>So the underlying question facing the Supreme Court is whether the tourism industry detrimentally impacts the continued existence of the animals or whether it actually helps protect the endangered population. The question set to re-examined on August 29 and currently awaits a decision.</p>
<p>But the real blockbuster case is a complicated patent dispute involving Novartis’ drug <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Imatinib">Glivec</a>.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, the case is the foremost of several drug-patent battles that will <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/SB10000872396390444233104577594973786074692.html">“determine how much protection foreign companies can get from Indian competitors that make lower-cost, generic versions of their products.”</a></p>
<p>At the heart of the matter is Section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act which states that patents aren’t issued for “the mere discovery of a new form of a known substance that does not result in the enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance…”</p>
<p>The application for Glivec was rejected on those grounds in 2006 and Novartis then sued India for breaching their WTO obligations. The Swiss company has asked that the court take a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/us-novartis-india-idUSBRE87I09M20120820">broad interpretation of the word ‘efficacy’</a> that would include its product.</p>
<p>India has earned a reputation as providing affordable lifesaving medicines in poor countries, but a ruling in favour of Novartis would likely result in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/07/business/global/indias-supreme-court-to-hear-long-simmering-dispute-on-drug-patents.html?pagewanted=all">substantial increases to medication costs</a>. For example, the drug has been available in the United States since 2001 (under the name Gleevec), but can cost upwards of $70,000 a year, compared to $2500 for Indian generic versions.</p>
<p>The much-anticipated case, which was originally scheduled to begin in March, will commence on September 11<sup>th</sup> and is <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Further_delays_in_Novartis_versus_India_patent_law_case.aspx">expected to last several months. </a></p>
