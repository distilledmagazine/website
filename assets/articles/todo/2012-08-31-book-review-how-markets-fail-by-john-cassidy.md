<p style="text-align: justify;">In this post-ideological world, there is still much power in ideology. Ideology tells a coherent story of the world, a story that sports a cool, clean internal logic, a story that mercilessly gobbles up all contrary facts and evidence in its moral superiority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is the ideology that drives policy-makers in this austerity-riven, post-financial-crisis world?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To its practitioners, it is no ideology at all. It is a rational, computer statistics-driven, technocratic approach to everything that doesn't admit room for politics and moral philosophy. Yet, as economist John Maynard Keynes once said, “Even the most practical man of affairs is usually in the thrall of the ideas of some long-dead economist”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Where did this ideology come from?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Cassidy explains in his book <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346449006&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">"How Markets Fail"</a>, a journey through the history of economics that traces how certain noxious ideas managed to not only survive critical rebuke but make their way into the very core of economics to corrupt economics departments, the finance sector, and even governments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cassidy begins with Adam Smith, the founder of modern economics, who developed the idea of the 'invisible hand': a supernatural image illustrating the efficiency of resource allocation through collective, aggregate market activities. Smith was quick to point out that the effective operation of markets and the invisible hand were dependent on mutual bonds of trust and cooperation among buyers and sellers. As Cassidy takes us through the development of economics in the late 19th and 20th centuries, we soon find this particular nuance washed away in favor of a more simplistic, mechanistic view of the economy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The economics of Hayek, Friedman, and more recently, Lucas, are all classified as 'utopian' by Cassidy. Given that nobody actually behaves like 'homo economicus' — the rational self-serving actor of most economic theory — the utopian label seems entirely appropriate. "How Markets Fail" really shines in the chapters where Cassidy explains the complex mathematics used to justify such concepts as rational expectations and revealed expectations. These concepts, while proven rigorously, lack real-world applicability and are built on faulty assumptions. Nevertheless, economists have claimed that even though these theories don't hold water, they can deliver quantitative results, and in the end that's all that matters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cassidy then goes on to outline the framework for 'reality-based' economics (a moniker that derives from the term<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Reality-based_community"> 'reality-based community'</a> first used by Karl Rove and the Mayberry Machiavellis of the George W. Bush Whitehouse). The planks of this field of economics include a more prominent role for game theory, rational irrationality, Keynes' beauty contest, group-think, hidden information, and the work of Hyman Minsky on speculative bubbles. Cassidy makes the compelling argument that these chinks in the armor of neoclassical economics must now take precedence given the failure of traditional economics to explain our current crisis and recession and prescribe adequate policy solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the last section of the book, Cassidy walks us through the 2007-2009 financial crisis, assiduously citing the various thinkers and ideas behind the policy decisions of technocrats such as Alan Greenspan and the various flaws in their reasoning that would be addressed by reality-based economics. The effect on the reader is like watching a car crash in slow-motion: you can't help but cringe the whole way through.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The only issue I had with "How Markets Fail" is that reality-based economics, while much more nuanced, circumspect, and critical than utopian economics, lacks the cohesion necessary to draw people away from the simple mathematical world of neoclassical economics. If a utopian economist and a reality-based economist were to approach a policy-maker with two different policy proposals, the average policy-maker would almost certainly pick the utopian proposal. The utopian proposal would have numbers and statistical analysis and charts with supply and demand crosses. It would offer a straightforward uncomplicated solution to a complex policy issue. Most importantly, it would have a simple story that anyone could understand. Hence why any politician with only an Econ 101 background proves that a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reality-based proposal, as it stands, would be a hodge-podge of exceptions and quibbles with nothing to tie them together. Moreover, the proposal would be less certain about the outcome of its implementation. For a policy-maker pressed for time and resources, the choice will be clear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think there is a lot of promise to reality-based economics and that the only way us barbarians at the gate could storm the castle is by telling an even better story than the neoclassicists without losing the all-important subtleties. In any case, "How Markets Fail" is an excellent step forward in building a new branch of economics more suited to the problems we face today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So when you hear stories about how a wealth tax or higher top-level income tax rate <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/george-osborne-emergency-wealth-tax" ">would destroy growth</a>, how the deficit is the greatest threat to economic recovery, and how many for-profit corporations are <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/boris-johnson-unpaid-work-young-people" what companies get access to free labor?">receiving free labor</a> courtesy the government, remember that behind every policy proposal that masquerades as sensible, inevitable, and necessary lurks a long history of intellectual development. To neglect where an idea comes from is to render it revelation. Fortunately, books like "How Markets Fail" help us remain ever critical and vigilant.</p>
