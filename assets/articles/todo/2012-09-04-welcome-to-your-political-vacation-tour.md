<p>With summer ending, most people have already taken their yearly vacation. Some of us will have stayed home, others might have departed to far away countries. But deciding where to go has become more and more difficult each year. Especially when you have an eye for global politics.</p>

<p>Let’s start with some of Europe’s classic holiday destinations. Portugal, Greece, Italy and Spain are all standard holiday countries, as each of them possesses a vibrant mix of sun, sea, Mediterranean cuisine and ancient history. And with the Euro crisis, this old and proud European heartland has become a lot cheaper too.</p>
<p>A minor downside is that strikes have become more frequent, which can be especially annoying when travelling between different cities. But this is of course nothing compared to the superb service you will receive as attracting tourists has become even more vital to the local economies*.</p>
<p>*This last advantage might not apply if you speak with a German accent...</p>
<p>If we go southwards, we encounter North Africa, which also has quite a few popular sun and sea destinations such as Morocco and Tunisia. Even cheaper than their European counterparts, these countries have also had their share of trouble in recent years.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the overall result of the Arab Spring could be considered positive. Tourists no longer have to worry about the ethics of the government providing them with a visa, and can still enjoy their bikini and cocktail holidays separated from the Muslim community.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>If we continue towards Africa, we find some of the most beautiful landscapes on earth. It is here that man and nature still touch. A safari is indeed the best way to enjoy the rare wildlife and forget about the slums you noticed when flying in. And although it has been pointed out that the ecological effects of this sort of tourism can go both ways, you can at least do your share by taking some snapshots of the animals in order to preserve them for eternity.</p>
<p>South America is <em>the</em> destination for party people. Fast growing cities with a lively community, beautiful men and women, and a <em>carpe diem</em> attitude are what define these countries. And for those who seek to enhance their experience even further there is always the possibility to find 'the right stuff'. Mind-blowing substances are widely spread and can be bought at a cheap price. With the World cup football and the Olympic games coming up, this service might however become slightly harder to obtain.</p>
<p>North America belongs to free spirits. The land of the free is especially suited for long roadtrips, allowing you to explore everything from the Statue of Liberty to the Bible Belt. In no other country will you experience the same feeling of reassurance during your vacation, as long as gun safety applies. Muslims (or people who look like them) however have to provide for an extra travel day due to random security checks.</p>
<p>Finally some travel tips for people with less conventional tastes. China is a country with a fascinating history, but unsuited to people who expect their internet to work properly. Russia will attract people born before 1989, but make sure to carry a Putin picture with you at all times. Japan has recently created a famous glow-in-the-dark industry. North Korea is unexplored terrain, but do realise you might look fat compared to the local population.</p>
<p>I apologize for my cynicism. Time to shut down the part of my mind responsible for political ethics and choose a destination for my own holiday.</p>
