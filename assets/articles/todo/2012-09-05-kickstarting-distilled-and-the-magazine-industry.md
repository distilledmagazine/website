<p>Magazines are <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/wondering-how-far-magazines-must-fall.html?_r=3&amp;ref=todayspaper">a dying industry</a>. They are difficult to sustain, and the market is overcrowded. The seemingly dwindling demand for high-quality long-form journalism cannot keep up with the cost of producing it. The traditional advertising and subscriptions-based magazine publishing business model just isn't working anymore. Journalism and publishing are becoming prestige industries sustained by unpaid internships that can only be filled by those <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/journalism-profession-money-class-internships">who can afford them</a>.</p>
<p>Besides, everything you pay for can be found for free on the internet.</p>
<p>What fool would seek to enter this moribund industry?<br />
Well, dear readers, we at <em><strong>Distilled Magazine</strong> </em>HQ prefer the term "eccentric visionaries."</p>
<p>After an ongoing discussion about the future of magazines in the digital age, we at <em><strong>Distilled </strong></em>have chosen to take a different tack from our competitors. That is why we have launched a<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/distilled-magazine-second-issue-print-edition?ref=live"> Kickstarter</a> to fund a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/distilled-magazine-second-issue-print-edition?ref=live">print edition of our second issue</a>. A $10 suggested donation gets you a copy in the mail, while higher donations gets you even more fun stuff.</p>
<p>Check out our introductory video below:<br />

Why a print edition? We feel that even in this age where everything is available online, nothing can match the physical heft of a magazine and the experience of flipping through its pages. We also believe in a print magazine's physical immediacy: its presence on a coffee table, the pleasure of loaning it to a friend, and if you're one of our contributors, the satisfaction of seeing your name and words in print. We hope that publishing a print edition allows us to share <em><strong>Distilled</strong></em> with even more people than ever before.</p>
<p>Why a Kickstarter page?</p>
<ul>
<li>For this first print edition, we wanted to eschew traditional advertising and sponsorship by letting our readers and friends buy into our overall project.</li>
<li>The money will only be deducted if we reach our goal, meaning that your donation will always count toward a tangible final product.</li>
<li>It allows us to raise funds past our goal, giving us the ability to publish even more than our initial target of 250 copies.</li>
<li>It's a convenient and fun means by which to donate to our project and also track our progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the market for traditional magazines may be shrinking, we feel that there is a market to be created for magazines that span multiple platforms, maintain a strong editorial stance, and are willing to adapt to a changing ideological and technological landscape. We aim for <em><strong>Distilled</strong></em> to be a pioneer in this emerging market.</p>
<p>This Kickstarter project is the first step in ensuring that <em><strong>Distilled</strong><strong> Magazine</strong></em> will always be independent and open to experimentation.</p>
