<p>Few words today, but <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/watch?v=mPPLooLfEXE" target="_blank">big talk</a>.</p>
<p>What makes rich countries rich, and poor countries poor? This massive question was once again raised this summer, this time in The New York Review of Books. The starting point was a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/what-makes-countries-rich-or-poor" target="_blank">book review by Jared Diamond of <em>Why Nations Fail</em> by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson</a>. This prompted a lively debate between Diamond and the authors.</p>
<p>Jared Diamond himself made his name in this field with his 1998 bestseller <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel</em>. His main thesis was that the fate of human societies throughout their long-term histories was heavily dependent on both the timing and the character of the Agricultural Revolution, roughly between 11,000 and 5000 years ago, depending on which continent. Or, put differently, wealth and poverty are mainly determined by long-term socio-geographic changes.</p>
<p>Acemoglu and Robinson, on the other hand, focused their research on more recent institutional developments. Their main insight is what they themselves call "the reversal of fortunes". They observed that countries that were relatively wealthy in 1500 became poor in the twentieth century (think: South-America, India, China), and countries that were poor in 1500, in general did very well half a millenium later (think: North-America and Australia). The main reason behind this reversal was allegedly the European colonization of the world, which exploited the rich areas but settled and developed the poor regions.</p>
<p>Put those two views in the Large Opinion Collider, and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/why-nations-fail" target="_blank">this is what you get</a>.</p>

<p>Let me take one big talking point from this debate. Already in his initial review, Jared Diamond was happy to concede that 50% of global inequalities can be explained by the institutional theory of Acemoglu and Robinson, but for the other half you need to consider the long-term geographic conditions. They however refused this compromise. In one of their statistical models, they did test a few random geographical variables, and they turned out insignificant.</p>
<p>So what they're basically saying is: "We put a few not-very-well-researched geographical dummies in our model, Mr. Diamond, and they prove that your whole book, and the whole scientific tradition it is built on for that matter, are false."</p>
<p>This is the academic counterpart of...</p>

<p>Yes, Dear Reader, you guessed it right: <a href="http://www.distilledmagazine.com/blog/?p=122" target="_blank">Acemoglu and Johnson are mathmos</a>!</p>
<p>So, whatever the mathmos may try to tell you, and whatever side you take in this debate, just remember that one dubiously constructed mathematical model does not disprove a whole tradition of sensible qualitative research!</p>
