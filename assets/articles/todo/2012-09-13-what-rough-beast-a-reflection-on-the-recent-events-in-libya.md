<p><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/a-timeline-of-the-attacks-in-libya-and-egypt----and-the-responses.php">On July 2nd</a>, a pseudonymous amateur filmmaker based out of the USA posted a poor-quality trailer for a crudely provocative film attacking Islam. On September 9th, a popular television chat show host in Egypt, known for his unyielding defense of radical movements, broadcast a clip of the trailer in Arabic. On the evening of September 11th, protestors began to gather around the US embassy in Cairo, breaching its gates and assaulting the embassy compound.</p>
<p>Meanwhile an attack on the US consulate kills Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith and damages the consulate building. The situation escalates over night. By 6am the following morning, three more State Department officers were dead and so was US Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens. The ambassador, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/it-wasnt-just-a-movie-us-_b_1877867.html">it's been said</a>, was in Benghazi to inaugurate a new 'American Corner', a place where potential visitors and tourists to the US can find out more about American culture, language, geography, etc. The consulate was destroyed.</p>
<p>Everyone ought to be free to express their opinion. What is not acceptable, however, is when that free speech turns to violence. Unfortunately, it seems that radicals on one side would love nothing more than to goad radicals on the other side into violent acts.</p>
<p>The attacks on US diplomatic missions in Egypt and Libya are not at all the only acts of political violence and hatred that are currently occurring in the world. But I believe that these attacks exhibit a worrying trend: an increasing polarization between violent fanatics and those who engage others with tolerance and respect.</p>
<p>This divide can be found everywhere. In the US, many have already condemned the attacks while emphasizing that many Americans are tolerant of other religions. While the filmmaker had the right to produce and distribute his film, his freedom of speech does not imply an implicit endorsement of its content. In Libya, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/56803">demonstrators in Benghazi</a> held a public show of sympathy and condolence to those killed and hurt in the attacks, pointing out quite rightly that such acts of violence are not in accordance with Islam and the integrity of the Libyan people. Meanwhile a minority of extremists in America continue to blame all Libyans and even all Muslims for the attacks, while among many groups across the Middle East and North Africa, America is blamed for every corrupt politician, businessperson, and dictator.</p>

<p>The world is changing rapidly. New challenges and threats are emerging faster than we can solve them. Problems that can be solved are neglected due to lack of political leadership, or worse, fear and greed. As the economic and political situations in many country deteriorate, people become more susceptible to radical ideologies that prey on people's terrors, furnish them with hatred, and promises them salvation only through violent resistance. Unfortunately, this phenomenon is not limited to either the developing or the developed world; its scope is universal.</p>
<p>Many have tried to define the center these past few turbulent years. For me, the center consists of those people who refuse to be radicalized out of fear. I hope it is this center that guides the world during this time of change.</p>
<p>I'd like to close with what I feel describes the threat we now face, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/potw351.html">an excerpt</a> from <em>The Second Coming</em> by W.B. Yeats:</p>
<blockquote><p>Turning and turning in the widening gyre<br />
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;<br />
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br />
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,<br />
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere<br />
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;<br />
The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br />
Are full of passionate intensity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Protestors have already <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/libya-attack-us-ambassador-aftermath-live">breached the walls</a> of the US embassy in Yemen. Let's hope for the best, and fiercely rebel against the worst.</p>
