<p>Writing is a dangerous business. Besides physical dangers such as mouse arm or enfolding obesity, there are the hidden traps of intellectual ownership. Are my thoughts original? Has this been written somewhere else? Might I – horror o horror – be accused of plagiarism?</p>
<p>Luckily for writers, they are not alone with their worries. Painters, musicians and generally all artists encounter similar problems.</p>
<p>Take for example Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>The big difference, however, between him and (most) writers is that he did not fear to copy but to be copied. And rightly so. Great minds have always been shamelessly copied. Lady Gaga stole Madonna’s ideas about fashion. The North Korean Kim family have been Stalinists for three generations. Modern day helicopters are cheap adaptations of Leonardo da Vinci’s models.</p>
<p>Jobs was not the type to let a similar thing happen to him. Instead he chose to go on the offensive. Famously declaring ‘thermonuclear war’ on Android, Apple’s new general Tim Cook has now fought and won the first battles.<a title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> But judging <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/watch?v=ZIUKayEb5UA">recent advertising</a> the enemy seems ready to strike back.</p>
<p><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/apple_vs_samsung11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-491" title="apple_vs_samsung1" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/apple_vs_samsung1-300x2331.jpg" width="300" height="233" /></a></p>
<p>Interestingly enough these first skirmishes have been legal fights. Why is this interesting? Because it points to one or two things.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>(1)   Steve Jobs is not an artist. Sorry to disappoint all the Apple-adepts who didn’t catch the earlier irony and believed I was genuinely on their side. Artists do not fight each other in court. Yes, they take legal steps against piracy, but how many cases are there of musicians officially charging a colleague for plagiarism? Or painters that complain about someone copying there style? A true artist works for his artistic pleasure, not global corporate domination.</p>
<p>(2)   The current legal system is incredibly flexible and allows for creative combat. Apple won its Silicon Valley home match against Samsung, but lost in <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/business-19433019">Tokyo</a>. Both computer giants have numerous claims against one another in <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/technology-19662049">different countries</a>. At first sight, this is a good sign because it implies that the judicial system works. But the problem is that these companies don’t seek justice, they seek profit. If national courts become the scene of a global corporate war this hints at the subtle ways in which modern consumer-capitalism is capable of integrating other non-global structures.</p>
<p>(3)   Human rights might improve in the near future – but only if global adversaries remain in competition and can use them to gain moral leverage. In response to the claims that manufacturers affiliated with Apple have been ignoring labour legislation, Samsung opted to perform <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/technology-19475556">preventive checks</a> of its own subcontractors. This is a good thing, but it is only the result of a rather vicious battle in the IT-industry. So in contrast to the semi-national legislation of point two, global juridical norms seem to be reinforced by global events (take Lybia, Syria, China, etc.).</p>
<p>Summing up the Apple vs. Samsung cases are symptoms of the extensive globalisation we currently experience. It also means that we will need to adapt. This has been said before (again the problem of being original here), but multinationals now play on a level that is difficult to grasp and understand, let alone legislate. As a consequence this global space can be used by them, and unless we want to lose more and more influence we need to find ways to manifest ourselves in it.</p>
<p>One final thought for people who still believe Apple is genuinely about creativity and design. Take a look at your chair. If it is Ikea, you might be sitting on ‘the next big thing’ in furniture as well.</p>
