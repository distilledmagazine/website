<p>About a week ago our very own Brecht Savelkoul discussed <a href="http://www.distilledmagazine.com/blog/?p=469">money and football</a>. Setting the scene for a number of Distilled-blogs relating to the topic of money (which reminds me: we are still looking for your generous support) he argued that Montpellier deserves respect for beating the much wealthier PSG football club.</p>
<p>Although I like football my real admiration goes out to another sport little understood in the United States: cycling. So because Brecht’s argument forms an excellent starting point for my own opinions, and also in order to equal the score between the two sports, you will have to endure my fanaticism today .</p>
<p>Last Sunday the Dutch city of Valkenburg was the location for this year’s UCI cycling World Championship. For those of you who have not grown up in a cycling-crazy country like Belgium it needs to be emphasized that the world championship is the biggest and most important one-day race of the season. The prestige the winner gets is enormous, as he obtains the right to wear a special jersey for the rest of the year. In terms of sponsoring this also is a big deal. Having the best rider in the world in your team means that sponsors will be more willing to open their purses.</p>
<p><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/755px-TonyMartinWorldChampionITT.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1170" title="755px-TonyMartinWorldChampionITT" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/755px-TonyMartinWorldChampionITT-300x238.png" width="300" height="238" /></a></p>
<p>This however creates a problem, and one that is well-known in the cycling world. During the world championship national teams are competing. But during the rest of the season riders get paid by commercial teams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this results in the following situation. The UK team, having no real chance to win this year nevertheless does a great job in preventing the breakaway to get too far ahead. Why? Because most of them are paid by Team Sky and so was the potential world champion Edvald Boasson-Hagen. The fact that the latter is Norwegian didn’t matter when the UK riders were confronted with the possibility of having a Sky-member attracting extra money during the following season.</p>
<p>Given the fact that the UK had no real winners this is sort of understandable, but the situation becomes more complicated when you look inside national teams. What happens when for example Spain has numerous favourites but each of them depends on a different commercial team? Will favourite one (and his commercial team members) sacrifice his chances for favourite two? In other words: does there still exist something as national altruism regardless of financial interest?</p>
<p>When you would ask the commercial teams they would say no. Even if they believed it was possible they would want it dead, given the fact that it could amount to helping the competition to take the extra sponsorship. For this reason they were the big drivers behind the reintroduction of the World Championship ‘team time trial’ (a specialist discipline), but on the condition that it would be their commercial teams competing. Immediately talk was heard of expanding this system to the standard World Championship, following the argument that it is illogical for riders to defend national interests when it might damage their financial prospects.</p>
<p>Basically this is saying that what isn’t worth money isn’t worth anything. And that everyone has to abide by this logic.</p>
<p>The reason why the World Championship is the biggest race is because it is a race between nations. For once in a year you cheer and shout for one team, and support every single rider in it. It isn’t the biggest race because you call it World Championship but because it has the emotions of a World Championship. Or would the Olympics also better when team GB would be replaced by team Sky?</p>
<p>For this reason (and other more obvious ones) I was very pleased to see the united Belgian team perform outstandingly, working for both of the favourites in their ranks and helping one of them to prevail. Belgium, the country with a battered national identity, was for one day capable of demonstrating why a World Championship is special and should remain special, regardless of the money involved.</p>
<p>For this reason, I nominate them my Montpellier.</p>
