<p>We've had a lot of stories about cheating and plagiarism in the US lately.  Just this week, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cheating-2012-9">New York Magazine</a> published an article about the cheating scandal that rocked Stuyvesant, an elite public high school in New York City. Officials found widespread cheating on assignments and standardized exams.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_569" align="alignnone" width="442"]<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/631px-Stuy_HS_sunny_jeh.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-569 " title="631px-Stuy_HS_sunny_jeh" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/631px-Stuy_HS_sunny_jeh.jpeg" width="442" height="420" /></a> Stuyvesant High School in New York City[/caption]</p>
<p>Why would some of the brightest kids in New York City – you have to take a test to get in – be compelled to cheat? Schools like Stuyvesant (which is certainly not unique in this situation) are boiler-rooms where the difference between a 96/100 and a 95/100 on an exam means life or death when it comes to college, career, and even social cachet. The highly competitive nature creates an attitude among students where it doesn't matter what you learn, but how you take the test. The students are sympathetic figures in a cruel system that equates merit with numbers.</p>
<p>But surely, once they reach their final destination (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, etc.), they have the freedom to learn, grow, and explore without constant pressure?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Alas, the hyper-competitive market for high-paying, prestigious jobs perpetuate a win-at-all-costs mentality, even at the most elite university of them all: <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/65e9845a-f6ca-11e1-8398-0327ab83ab91_blog.html">Harvard</a>. Moreover, as students found that they can consistently get away with murder in high school, they continue to push the boundaries of what they can do to get to the top in college. And during that time, they'll likely receive praise from authorities and themselves.</p>
<p>Cheating isn't just limited to school. In recent months we've seen the near fatal-woundings of <a href="http://www.bostonreview.net/BR37.5/fareed_zakaria_journalism_ethics_speaking_fees.php">Fareed Zakaria for plagiarism</a>, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/jonah_lehrer_plagiarism_in_wired_com_an_investigation_into_plagiarism_quotes_and_factual_inaccuracies_.html">Jonah Lehrer for fabrication and plagiarism</a>, and a slew of bankers at <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/business-18671255">Barclay's for manipulating LIBOR</a>.</p>
<p>But it's not just a problem in the USA and the UK. Romania's whole political hierarchy has been rocked by the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/world/europe/romania-plagiarism-scandal-ensnares-prime-minister.html">discovery of plagiarism</a> in the Prime Minister's doctoral thesis.  Even the former German defense minister, in the very heart of Europe, was <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/german-defence-minister-resigns-plagiarism">brought down by plagiarism</a>. These anecdotes do not make a trend, nor do they imply that everyone is a liar and a cheat. But they are symptoms of greater underlying problems.</p>
<p>There isn't much that separates these "grades-at-any-cost" students from many in the intellectual, political, and business elite. In a world where you're judged on whether you get to the next stage (of prestige, money, whatever), no one cares how you got there. Until you get caught of course. Lucky for you that your cohort, who also believe they got their on merit, are ready to rehabilitate you at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>Perhaps then it isn't much of a surprise that the <em><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cheating-2012-9">New York</a></em><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cheating-2012-9"> Magazine piece</a> about Stuyvesant high school ends where it began, with a confessed outwardly penitent cheater, Nayeem Ahsan, lamenting his fall from grace, but hoping to one day join the rat race back to the top. When asked what he wanted to be when he grew up, the answer couldn't have been anything else.</p>
<p>An investment banker.</p>
<p>Godspeed Nayeem, you may just have what it takes to make it.</p>
