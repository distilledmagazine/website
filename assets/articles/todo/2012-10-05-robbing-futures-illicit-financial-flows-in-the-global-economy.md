<p style="text-align: justify;">Raymond Baker has spent over 50 years in international business, notably in Nigeria, and has an MBA from Harvard. Nonetheless, the Global Financial Integrity director’s Louisiana spark remains in his character and Language when he asserts that “illicit financial flows” - a term he coined - “are the most damaging economic condition to development.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">UNDP and several other groups besides Raymond’s own, have recently turned an eye to the problem of illegal and detrimental cross-border transactions. Specifically transactions out of less developed countries. Estimated to be valued at over a trillion annually this dwarfs the 120 billion that developed countries send in as aid. This concerns citizens world-wide as the impact of aid dollars provided by Western and local taxpayers is thereby rendered moot.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to UNDP, the primary vector for these flows is “trade mispricing”. This works by paying more than world market prices for good being imported. This is beyond tariffs, and has nothing to do with geographical or bureaucratic difficulties, although all of those provide good cover stories. Instead, the goal is to intentionally pay more for a good to shuffle money to a non-taxable hub or large financial centre, where somebody trustworthy is waiting to keep it safe until you get out yourself. The company loses out (many run at unnecessary deficits), economies lose out since businesses are not actively trying to grow, and countries lose out because their commodity revenues are pillaged this way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For multinational corporations, this means being able to shift funds to tax-havens. They can have unimaginable and unreported surpluses on tropical islands, while registering deficits at branches in the rest, kept afloat by re-transfer payments. This is why it looks like the British Virgin Islands are the second biggest investor globally in China (after Hong Kong).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Chief Financial Officer of such a multinational however, these measures may seem necessary to remain competitive. at the top level of international business, edging out the competition means a marginally lower tax rate. And yet this translates to 35 billion USD having been siphoned out of the Bangladeshi economy between 1990 and 2008. Angola lost 34 billion and was the second biggest loser. Numbers three and four on the list are Lesotho and Chad. According to the UNDP Human Development Index scores these countries respectively rate 146, 148, 160, and 183, out of 187 countries measured. Whether the cumulative US$101 billion lost in these countries affected their social and economic performances is speculative of course but even a small increase in income can have a huge impact on standard of living when one lives near the poverty line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Developed countries’ national governments all have an economic incentive in stopping illicit flows, as they lose out as much as developing countries. Companies and tax-havens are the only beneficiaries, and this is not about making their lives difficult, it is about fairness to those whose lives are made difficult by the current asymmetrical regime.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the need, the problem is not easily solved though. First of all, getting figures is difficult. The IMF tracks trades in commodities and hard goods, meaning international comparisons to find over-pricing are possible with hard goods. This is not done in services however and determining “brand value”, let alone brand value in a specific geographic location, is so subjective it seems almost futile to enforce norms. What can be enforced however is reporting, such as “most favoured country” statistics when a company trades one good in multiple places.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accountability is equally essential. This is a trite and overused term in development circles but in this case it refers literally to accounts and specifically “natural account ownership”. Companies can be, for example, be forced by multilateral agreement to report the names of individuals who are responsible for accounts (currently they are not). Next, CEOs and CFOs can be made to sign off personally on accounts so they are personally criminally liable if companies are found to be shirking regulations in any given country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">India at the moment is a leading reformer, especially in tax, customs, growth equity and governance regimes. Many other countries are on board to study and implement changes. Christian Friis Bach, Danish Minister for Development and Cooperation promised in front of Mr. Baker this past Monday to ensure the Danes proceed with reforms. Denmark, it was noted, is in particular a known hideout for holding companies. The world’s largest mining company, BHP Billiton, has two subsidiaries there. It is unlikely they are there for anything they’ll find in the soil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Still, many actors may cause challenges. While the IMF and World bank are on board nominally in terms of reducing corruption and by providing trade figures, they have yet to officially engage in real efforts to reduce illicit flows. Then, besides the tax-havens and other multinationals, major auditing firms stand to be some of the biggest losers. This despite the fact that they are the ones entrusted with the job of highlighting irregularities, such as massive budget fluctuations in the month before the termination of a fiscal year. Their silence and unwillingness makes them complicit, and yet the client-auditor bond only functions if there is a certain element of trust and secrecy. To an extent, perhaps this is true to the nature of business itself. A reconciliation between the principals of free entreprise and equitable development will not be easy, but in Dhaka and Luanda, it is not hard to see that it is necessary.</p>
