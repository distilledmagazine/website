<p>One cannot step into the same stream twice.This was true back the fifth century BCE, when Heraclitus of Ephesus first wrote down this aphorism, but it is even more so today.</p>
<p>When the first issue of Distilled Magazine was published in July, we and our contributors stepped into a stream that was completely different from the one we experience today. Our authors walked into this stream and scooped out of it a bucket full of news, facts, and bytes. They distilled it once, twice, as much as needed to brew something strong and characterful, but drinkable. Together, they created a brewage called "The Global Crisis of Confidence", a compelling yet discomfortable view on our present society.</p>
<p>Or rather, on our society at the time, because today we stand in a different stream. What would happen if we'd take a new bucket of news, and brew it using the same recipes? Will this new distillation still taste like a crisis of confidence? To find out, I will follow up on three articles from our last issue.</p>
<p><em>1) <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/the-financial-crisis-of-shareholder-primacy/">The Financial Crisis of Shareholder Primacy</a>, by Mike Marin.</em><strong> </strong>Has the banking system seen sufficient reforms to prevent a next big crisis? There's still quite a range of opinions on this topic. The Economist argues that the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/21562911">reaction against the financial industry has gone far enough</a>, and that further regulations would only hamper the recovery. On the left however, people argue that a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cooper-banking-reform-conference-speech">further crackdown on the most fraudulent practices is required</a>. The problem of shareholder primacy is adressed very rarely though. You read it here first.</p>
<p><em>2) <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/no-end-to-the-panic/">No End to the Panic</a>, by Dan Baker.</em><strong> </strong>The biggest storm is behind us now, it seems. When we published the issue in July, politicians still found themselves playing <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/euro-crisis-3">on the brink of collapse</a>. Now European leaders seems to have <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/euro-crisis">steadied the ship, even though the port is still out of sight</a>. Yet, the bold plans for recovery Dan Baker called for are still shining in their absence. But maybe we shouldn't just blame this on the professional politicians in charge. Where would they get the legitimacy for those decisions? Maybe its time for civilians of EU countries — eurosceptics and federalists alike — to answer the call of people like Daniel Cohn-Bendit, and have a real democratic debate over the future of Europe.</p>
<p><em>3) <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/the-ongoing-sack-of-rome/">The Neverending Sack of Rome</a>, by Davide Testuggine.</em><strong> </strong>New reports are suggesting <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/silvio-berlusconi-election-run-italy-prime-minister_n_1950763.html">Berlusconi might support Monti instead of seeking reelection in 2013</a>. Has he realized his game is over? Or does this prove he's happy running things from behind the scene? The jury's still out.</p>
<p>At the moment we're very busy finishing the second issue of Distilled Magazine, but that doesn't mean we're considering the first one finished. We realize that in an ever moving stream, coming up with definitive answers is nigh impossible. That's why we at Distilled aren't just committed to raising a new issue every three months. We also want to follow up on the older ones, to keep the debate alive.</p>
<p>To be continued.</p>
