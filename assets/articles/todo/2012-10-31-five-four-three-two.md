<p>At last! The second issue of Distilled Magazine, themed "Individualism vs. Collectivism", is ready for its big launch. We finished editing, uploading, editing, lay-outing, editing, promoting, and more editing. And writing of course, almost forgot about the writing.</p>
<p>The magazine will be available on this site 5:05 pm GMT.</p>
<p>But before we take off, I have to say a few words of thank — words like "thank" and "you", for example — to all the people that helped us make this happen.</p>
<p>First of all, in the name of the Distilled editorial board, I'd like to thank you, Dear Reader, because it would be pretty pointless writing a magazine without an audience. Secondly, we would like to send an extra dose of unfiltered gratitude to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/distilled-magazine-second-issue-print-edition" target="_blank">those readers who decided to donate</a> money to help us produce a print edition. (Your copies have been sent out, by the way. If you have given us your address at least.) And last but not least, we'd like to thank the writers and designers who contributed to this issue of Distilled Magazine, for saving us the embarressment of having to send an empty Word document to the printing press. Or even worse, writing everything ourselves.</p>
<p>I also want to send a personal word of thank to my fellow editors Sarang and Bram. Not only for producing the kind of Online Magazine I like to read, but most of all for taking me on board of this exciting project. I wish them both very good luck with their election campaign (yes, at least one third of the Distilled Board is doing his bit keeping away crazy Mormons from nuclear launch codes) and doctoral dissertation respectively.</p>
<p>I'd like to end with a quick disclaimer. Even though we made the decision to schedule the launch on Halloween's Night, the Distilled Board is NOT responsible for <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/joss-whedon-romney-zombie-endorsement" target="_blank">any kind of zombie apocalypse</a> this might cause. So make sure to keep your brains with you at all times, and don't forget to take them with you when you leave this site.</p>
<p>Have a nice read!</p>
