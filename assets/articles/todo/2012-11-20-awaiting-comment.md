<p style="text-align: justify;">It was the original intention of Distilled Daily to have a couple of nice calm weeks. Just some reflection on the American elections, chewing over what direction the world would take under the renewed Obama leadership. Unfortunately we already got caught out by the first bump in the road, an old crack in the paving called the Israeli-Palestine conflict. So let me try and start out to see whether or not there remains anything sensible to say about this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Admittedly, I am no specialist on the subject. Unfortunately enough, our own Middle-East commentator is currently touring through the Congo. Maybe he felt it coming and sought refuge in some <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/20/world/africa/rebels-issue-ultimatum-to-congo-forces-in-goma.html?ref=world">calmer</a> part of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maybe I should leave this blog post for someone who knows his/her way around social media. Apparently, this has become one of the first wars to be fought out in public <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/hamas-israel-and-why-social-media-like-twitter-and-facebook-are-a-new-front-in-the-war-for-gaza-8320547.html">cyberspace</a>. Instead of the one-sided use of social media by the Arab Spring protesters, this time at least both sides regularly update their status. But as even my own Facebook wall receives regular posts related to the war, there is no reason why I cannot produce an interesting story on my own, right?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">By the way, how kind of the Israeli Defense Forces to keep track of their <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/watch?v=M3laaKdmpag&amp;list=UUawNWlihdgaycQpO3zi-jYg&amp;index=5&amp;feature=plcp">scores</a>. But this implies that I should not seek for someone plugged into Facebook and Twitter, but for a commentator who knows how to count. And at least in this matter I know who would be suited. Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 was <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/blackops2">released</a> earlier this week, so I simply need to find someone who was amongst the many <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/917739-call-of-duty-black-ops-ii-launch-sees-gamers-brave-cold-to-be-first-in-line">queuing</a> three or four hours in order to get a copy. People with an intimate knowledge of modern warfare are hard to find these days, so when they get out of their couches I need to seize the moment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The problem is that I cannot ask any academic specialist. These people are hugely overworked. Whilst they were still recovering from the shock of the Arab Spring, Syria plunged into civil war. And when they were nearly accustomed to this rather confused situation, Iran stepped up its nuclear pressure on the Western World (or was it the other way around? Things are indeed getting messy these days). So confronting them with another new event might lead to outright panic in numerous departments, I fear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or maybe I should leave the commentary simply to the people who are actually most suited for this job, the men and women reporting directly from the  front line. Although they had a couple of busy years, they are still there, trying to bring the war to us as objective as humanly possible. Maybe they can make sense of it all. But after decades and decades of futile war, I am afraid even they will have no clue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So maybe I should simply give up, and just wait for the next phase of the fighting. As I am myself a university-trained, shooter-playing blogger operating from Brussels, I fear that might be the only sensible thing to do today.</p>
