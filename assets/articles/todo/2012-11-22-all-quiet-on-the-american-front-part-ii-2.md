<p style="text-align: justify;">In Charlottesville, Virginia, you can walk up nearly any hill, in any neighborhood, and see the nearby mountains. When the sun rises, the trees ignite like aged tungsten. The autumn leaves glow a dim red, then warm up to a dirt-orange, before they finally catch fire and glow a bright amber hue. The hills look like mounds of freshly husked grains, and when you breathe in the air it stings your throat and coats it with damp.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The forested hills of Virginia are one of the many cradles of American democracy. It was in Charlottesville that Thomas Jefferson, America's 3rd president and author of "The Declaration of Independence", built his home Monticello. In the nearby town of Orange, James Madison (Jefferson's successor and framer of the American constitution) lived at his plantation estate Montpelier. The combined work of these two Presidents had established some of the central tenets of the American democratic system, such as freedom of religion, checks and balances, and separation of powers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The area around Charlottesville was also home to America's first constitutional crisis – a crisis that nearly destroyed the American experiment in its infancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under Presidents Washington and Adams, America persisted as an ostensibly non-partisan democracy. Parties were seen as distasteful and counter to the goal of democratically serving one's constituents. Yet, soon after the nation's founding, many of America's political leaders found themselves on opposite sides on the issue of the role of the federal government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On one side were the Federalists, led by Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, who opposed the formation of political parties, believed in a more centralised national government, and a dominant role for the elite, educated, land-owning class. On the other side were the Democratic-Republicans, formed by Jefferson and Madison in Charlottesville, who believed in a greater role for state government and for more engagement from the various socio-economic groups of America (with the inevitably disastrous exception of slaves and women).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A tie in the Electoral College, which elects the President, in 1800 soon precipitated a dispute in which the formation of these parties became an integral part of the American political system (and also indirectly led to the murder of Hamilton by Vice-President Aaron Burr soon after).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After much alliance building and negotiation, Jefferson was elected President. The triumph of Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans brought a renewed vigor to American politics. The non-elites were soon compelled to become more involved in their country's political affairs. These groups distributed literature, organized campaigns, canvassed neighbours, and even ran for political office. In many ways, party politics rejuvenated American democracy by giving birth to more equal-opportunity forms of organizing and campaigning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Had the anti-partisan Federalists won the election of 1800, however, the country may very well have plunged into civil war rather than choose to mediate political disputes through party politics. The formation of dominant political parties, as can be seen in many ex-Soviet democracies, could be seen as a sign that democracy was maturing rather than caving to venal interests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I headed down to Charlottesville from Washington, DC, in early October, I was largely unaware of the role Jefferson and his home played in averting our first significant democratic crisis, nor did I realize the thread which connected the vision of the founding Virginian politicians to the modern campaign.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All I knew was that I would be making a lot of phone calls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Stay tuned for Part III</em></p>
