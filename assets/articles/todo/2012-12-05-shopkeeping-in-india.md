<p style="text-align: justify;">When the Indian government recently announced their intention to raise the cap on foreign direct investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail, foreign vendors and international investors breathed a collective sigh of relief.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Retail giants like Walmart, Tesco, and Carrefour have been eagerly waiting for the opportunity to tap into a sector that annually generates over $500 billion, of which only about 6% comes from organized retailers. This is a stark contrast from fellow BRIC’s China (20%) and Brazil (36%), and incredibly less than the United States (85%). With a burgeoning middle class, increasing per-capita income, and unprecedented urbanization, India’s retail sector has tremendous potential to drive national economic growth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Foreign investors would be required to invest at least 50% of their spending into back-end infrastructure; a move proponents say would go a long way towards modernizing India’s woeful distribution network that currently results in 40% of domestic food rotting before being consumed. The enormous amount of waste not only costs the country billions of pounds each year, but also translates to unnecessarily inflated food prices.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">But in-step with the stereotype of a political system that is notoriously fragmented, the ruling United Progressive Alliance coalition soon pulled an embarrassing about-face after several key coalition parties threatened to reject the reform measures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite it being an executive decision that normally wouldn’t require legislative approval, the left-leaning opposition coalition, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party successfully lobbied to deliberate the issue under a rule which allows for matters of significant public interest to be debated and voted on by both Houses of Parliament. The issue is going through both houses this week.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the government keeps trumpeting the potential benefits of reform, the opposition continues beating the nationalist drum against further permeation of Western culture. It’s hard to know if they're playing politics, or if they genuinely want to prevent any further foreign integration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is certain is a sense of worry that allowing foreign companies to expand their influence will drive a stake through local retailers, an embedded part of Indian culture. Walmart especially seems to concern India, because it is estimated that an investment of $500 million within the first five years would be needed in order to operate. This enormous price-tag is a short-term hurdle for European retailers that are constrained by the debt crisis, and is therefore said to favour Walmart.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Congress will wrestle on this week with the question of whether India is ready for Walmart, and will possibly decide to leave the decision to the individual states. But in the end,  the ultimate decision whether to embrace foreign retailers will be made by the consumer, and Walmart is willing to bet that locals are more motivated by low prices than they are by upholding a traditional way of life.</p>
