<p style="text-align: justify;">GUYS, Fox News has got a clear conservative bias, and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NYTOnIt" target="_blank">The Times Is ON IT</a>. Wait hang on, they aren't... More on that later. Before we return to the cold, dark heights of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/watch?v=QIrAEp8-Ft0" target="_blank">Bullshit Mountain</a>, we're going to the British Isles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Britain, the leading news network has been in a difficult place recently. <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/cable-news-ratings-november_n_2205087.html" target="_blank">Unlike Fox News</a>, the BBC has been publicly called out for malpractices. A recent scandal broke out around <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Jimmy_Savile_sexual_abuse_scandal#BBC_comments_and_investigations" target="_blank">its role in the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse case</a>. The accusation, that the BBC had covered up allegations of sexual abuse against Savile during his time at the channel, has led to the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/bbc-crisis-george-entwistle-resigns" target="_blank">resignation of director general George Entwistle</a>. For some this was enough to call for the end of public broadcasting?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well no, because that's exactly the benefit of a public broadcaster. They can be called out for their behaviour by the public.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not so for Fox, they are accountable to — regular readers all together now — <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/individualism-is-bad-for-business/" target="_blank">their shareholders</a>, i.e. <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/0.jpg" target="_blank">the Sith Lord</a>. So when another incredibly credible story about Fox News came out this week, no one even blinked.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Picture-5.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1815" title="Picture 5" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Picture-5-300x240.png" width="270" height="216" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/35623699_1_roger-ailes-david-h-petraeus-fox-news" target="_blank">Bob Woodward broke the story</a> this week about Fox secretly negotiating with General Petraeus in 2011, then commander of the Afghan forces, based on <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/c0aa0c72-3d6d-11e2-a2d9-822f58ac9fd5_video.html" target="_blank">a leaked tape</a>. While the actual content might not be very surprising, the tone is nothing less than repulsive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What we hear is the audience of an obedient Fox servant with <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Petraeus#cite_ref-autogenerated1_59-1" target="_blank">King David</a>. She starts by making sure His Majesty is pleased by the coverage he's getting from her station. Then she pleas for him to return home a hero and run for president. He ends up refusing because he's more interested in taking over the CIA, as "covert ops is the real growth industry". King David, Lord of the Drones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That's not the most disturbing part of the story though. After all, Fox sucking up to the military isn't that big a surprise. But the other media not reporting it...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As mentioned earlier, The New York Times decided to leave the story out of their main edition, and hide it in <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/individualism-is-bad-for-business/" target="_blank">a small paragraph on an insignificant blog</a>, together with Kate Middleton's pregnancy. (Insert bathwater joke.) Even the Washington Post, the paper that broke the story in the first place, made sure it was out of the news <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/todays-front-page-december-5-2012" target="_blank">the next day</a>. The reason is clear. Both concerned newspapers are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, as <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/chart" target="_blank">NYT</a> and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/chart1" target="_blank">WPO</a>. (Anyone thinks that sounds like two Star Wars droids?) And markets just don't like controversy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Suddenly the public model of the BBC <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/watch?v=vJIjTviLLTs" target="_blank">doesn't look so bad after all</a>. There are caveats though. Public broadcasters like Russia Today, CCTV News, and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wikileaks-cables-al-jazeera-qatari-foreign-policy" target="_blank">even Al Jazeera</a> have been known to speak the word of their government. But an open, democratic society like the U.S. should be able to avoid it. So in 2016, the message will be simple: Vote Big Bird, not Petraeus.</p>
