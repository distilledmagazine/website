<p style="text-align: justify;">The Holiday season is a wonderful time for reflection. Reflection on things like: “<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/watch?v=32bPbDgzsEc">How a group of people</a> can be so positive towards capitalism, and yet find a way to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/watch?v=j3hDCMV5PyE">rail against consumerism</a> after their <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/watch?v=aeSgBL7gpAk">Black Friday shopping</a>, because it’s taking attention away from <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/watch?v=5A0-u85aAYg">sweet baby Jesus</a>?”, or “Why do we celebrate a guy who flipped tables on materialists by buying each other presents on a pagan holiday in the first place?” Probably because it’s better than letting the pagans have all the fun.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because let's face it, the best parts of Christmas are the ones that have nothing to do with christianity at all. They are the parts that the Danish would use the term “hyggeligt” to describe. And remember we’re talking about the happiest people on Earth here so they know what they’re talking about: holidays, coziness, and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/why_danes_are_so_much_happier_than_americans">enlightened capitalism</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So what is "Hyggeligt" and why is it relevant to the greatest thing to happen to December since axial tilt? It describes the parts of the season that prevent us in the Northern hemisphere from turning back into dentists, bankers, or <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/most-suicidal-occupations-2011-10#1-marine-engineers-are-189-times-more-likely-to-commit-suicide-19" target="_blank">marine engineers</a> in the dead of Winter.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8g4Ztf7hIM&amp;w=270]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These things are in no particular order: wearing funny hats, dressing warm, making cookies, visiting friends, singing even though you shouldn’t, snowball fights, traditional markets, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Tuborgjulebryg.aspx" target="_blank">re-packaged beer</a>, eggnog, glüwein, cognac chocolates, rumballs, snapps, and being cuddly with people you wouldn’t even consider tolerating most of the time. And tolerating the music they bring with them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which is the point. Forget shopping-mart Christianity, why not just become shopping-mart holiday enthusiasts? For the Spaghetti Monster knows that’s what the season is about anyways. Why not just extract all the parts we like about the season from those we don’t really care about?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Seinfeld has rescued those of us left in <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/watch?v=0kRAKXFrYQ4" target="_blank">this awkward position</a>. He has given us  another piece of artillery in the "War on Christmas". The holiday of Festivus, an antidote to the religious and consumerist symbolism of the holiday season.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On Festivus, you don’t need to feel bad about making a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/watch?v=IlojNh9uUSY" target="_blank">lights display to the tune of Gangnam Style out of your house</a>, rather than erecting a ridiculous nativity scene. (Ridiculous, because there is no way that Mary looked that graceful after an undefined period of labour in a Middle-Eastern shack. Especially if she was a virgin, with a musically-inclined child, and a toe-tapping lamb for midwife. That said, I’d be in favour of keeping the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Biblical_Magi" target="_blank">three Zoroastrian priests</a>. People need to  realise that bombing Iran is not a nice way to thank them for the myrrh and gold.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So let us make Festivus! We can lament our obsession with material things, air our grievances, raise a pole (for whatever purpose you should choose), and watch Seinfeld, gløgg-in-hand. Let me happily raise mine to Festivus! A holiday for the rest of us!</p>
