<p style="text-align: justify;">As state troopers clad in riot gear, armed with tear gas and batons stood guard outside against the more than 12,000 protesters Tuesday, Governor Rick Snyder was inside the state Capitol, making Michigan the country’s 24th state to pass "right to work" legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an intentionally confusing term. In essence, these laws give non-unionized employees the ability to opt-out of the collective bargaining process. They make paying dues voluntary and encourage free-riding, as individuals will still reap the benefits of collective bargaining without contributing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What’s interesting about the narrative taking shape in Michigan is that it’s different than the way in which right-to-work stories traditionally play out. These measures tend to be primarily justified by the debatable economic value associated with anti-union employers that flock into town, thus stirring economic growth by creating new jobs (albeit at considerably lower wages).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Michigan though, the typically less-cited reason for right-to-work legislation is used, the issue of worker freedom and personal choice. This suggests the issue is political, rather than economic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/8268128574"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1958" title="right-to-work" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/right-to-work.jpg" width="209" height="269" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Discussion of attracting new jobs to the Wolverine State has been decidedly muffled amidst classic Republican red-meat discourse. Governor Snyder framed it as being "pro-worker" rather than "anti-labour". President Obama though, during a visit to a local engine plant 20 miles from Detroit, called the measure "the right to work for less money”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Needless to say this is a largely political law. Most telling is who it does not cover. Despite having contracts that are most gold-plated, police and firefighters unions are conspicuously absent from the scope of this legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you believe Harold Meyerson of the Washington Post, it’s because these unions often endorse the Republicans. In a swing state like Michigan, where Obama just won by 9 points and a Democratic Senator was re-elected by over 20 points, that’s a rare occurrence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Politicized exceptions aside, unions have very much come to be seen as pariahs in society. But as they remain an an essential element of a strong middle class, right-to-work laws could prove detrimental to everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This blow also threatens to reverberate to neighbouring states and over into Canada. Michigan traditionally competes with Ontario for investments from carmakers, and Tuesday’s news will undoubtedly renew and increase calls for similar action "to stay competitive". In Ontario, the Liberal government is woefully unpopular and seen as largely inept, and it’s likely that right-to-work legislation will be a central plank of the Conservative party’s agenda in 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even federally, opposition parties are warning that right-to-work legislation could soon find its way to Canada. Whether we’re ready for it or not, it looks as though the right to work could be here to stay.</p>
