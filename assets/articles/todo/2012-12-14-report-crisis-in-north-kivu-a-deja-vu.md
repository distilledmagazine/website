<p style="text-align: justify;">Since April 2012, a tutsi led rebellion with the apparent support of Rwanda is challenging the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in North Kivu. You might have the impression that you have heard this before, and this is no surprise. The current situation is a mere replica of the crisis that shook the region and killed thousands in 2008. The reason for this repetition: despite all the nice talk, nothing has changed in this restive part of the country, and neither the government nor the rebels or their backers have implemented any of the reforms needed to solve the crisis.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In March 2012, Congo’s president Joseph Kabila ordered the arrest of one of the country’s Army Generals, Bosco Ntaganda, in order to transfer him to the International Criminal Court (ICC) where he is wanted for war crimes. Kabila, who previously had protected this high ranking officer, changed his mind in order to please his western bakers after being criticized for wining the highly contested presidential elections in 2011. The General, a former National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) rebel who had subsequently been integrated into the Congolese armed forces (FARDC), defected from the army and took to the bush with several hundreds of his soldiers. The FARDC launched an offensive to capture Ntaganda. However, President Kabila ordered to halt the attack despite the fact that his troops were close to victory and had surrounded Bosco. This unexplained event allowed the renegade army officer to flee with his men and reorganize in a restive area of North Kivu, where he renamed his group “M23” in reference to the agreement of 23 March 2009 between the government and the CNDP. This agreement stipulated that the rebels would integrate into the FARDC and put an end to their rebellion, but was, according to Bosco, not respected by Kinshasa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The group itself comes from a specific branch of the CNDP and is mainly formed out of Tutsi. However, rather than to protect the interests of their community like the CNDP did, its members mainly defected from the FARDC in order to defend their business interests that were established under the CNDP and which had been perpetuated after the integration into the Congolese army. This pattern of exploitation and control of natural resources by armed groups, including the FARDC, is recurrent in the eastern DRC and very often one of the main sources of conflict in the area. Once more it is at the root of the current conflict, although it is amplified by foreign involvement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed, Rwanda is once more directly involved with the mutiny. Kigali supports the M23 because of the common ethnic identity it shares with the rebels, but also because they allow the country to freely exploit the DRC’s natural riches through networks of illegal mineral exploitation. This time however, Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame has been strongly condemned by the international community. Last summer the UN issued a report accusing Rwanda of supporting the rebels in the DRC. The UK, the US, Holland, Germany and Sweden even froze aid to the central African nation. Even though this will not hurt the Rwandan economy (this foreign aid only represents about 3% of the entire state budget) it remains a strong symbol, especially since it includes the US and the UK, Rwanda strongest western allies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A recurrent negative aspect of the current crisis is the blatant military ineffectiveness of the Congolese army. Internal infighting, corruption, deliquescence and the total lack of professionalism of the FARDC allowed a poorly armed and trained rebel group of about 700 fighters to hold off a governmental army of thousands , trained by several countries including the US. The FARDC officers and soldiers are regularly defecting to the M23 or simply spend their time dealing with illegal business activities. Since April, the M23 has conquered a large chunk of territory in both the Kivus and is now administrating them as an independent state. It named local administrators and set up its own government. It also levies high taxes on any supply trucks going into the central city of Goma, which sent food prices sky rocking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The UN force named MONUSCO, which is gathered in the Kivus, is despite its 17,000 troops as inefficient as ever. MONUSCO is totally incapable of engaging the rebels or even defending civilian areas where interethnic fighting is starting to take place. Like it did several times in the last decade, the MONUSCO prefers to retreat to the outskirts of Goma rather than to protect Congolese population. The main reason for this incapacity is not the mandate or the capacity - the MONUSCO has clear rules of engagement and the Indian army leading it  is a professional force equipped with helicopters and armed vehicles – but rather the fact that the countries providing troops refuse to pay the internal political price of soldier deaths. The only significant step the MONUSCO took was to support the FARDC with helicopter strikes in some of the few offensives it conducted against the rebels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, like in the past, this new episode of violence in the eastern DRC has increased interethnic violence. Since the crisis erupted in March, attacks and retaliations between armed groups and militias belonging to different ethnicities become daily. In particular, attacks against the Rwandophone minorities are very important and they often receive the implicit support of Kinshasa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the regional level mediation was initiated by Uganda, but thid did not bear any significant result yet. At the beginning of August and again in September and October, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) convened under the supervision of President Museveni in order to discuss the nature of the neutral force to be deployed in Eastern Congo, which was agreed upon earlier in Ethiopia. After four summits, the participants could not find a compromise and left the table with the sole commitment to meet again soon. With the different actors refusing to change their positions, the prospects for a change in the status quo are therefore slim. One can expect the situation to remain at a standstill unless military operations change the reality on the ground.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a whole, violence is once more spreading in the Eastern DRC. All the usual ingredients of the deadly cocktail are still present: natural resources, foreign involvement, ethnic rivalry, complete lack of government control, inefficient security forces and insignificant UN military involvement. The fact that the international community has for once taken measures against the rebel’s foreign backer, Rwanda, is a good sign but still not enough. However, without a significant security sector reform, an increased presence and control of the eastern provinces and serious regulation and control of the natural resource exploitation by Kinshasa, it is doubtful that peace and stability can prevail in the region.</p>
