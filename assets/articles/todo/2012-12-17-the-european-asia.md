<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to contact with Europe, Japan has one of the most unique histories in the world. In 1616, the <em>Bakufu</em> leadership took the decision to close the country for foreign influences. Christian communities were vigorously persecuted and only the ports of Hirado and Nagasaki remained accesible for (strictly controlled) import trade. It took more than two centuries and the gunboat-diplomacy of Commodore Perry to reopen the country. Even so, Japan still managed to escape outright colonialism during the following decades.</p>
<p>Now, long after the seventeenth century and the Age of Empire, Japan looks more European than ever. According to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/world-asia-20728387">Rupert Wingfield-Hayes</a>, BBC World reporter in Tokyo, the country has</p>
<ul>
<li>A constituency without faith in the traditional political class</li>
<li>A massive debt of around 230% of GDP</li>
<li>An economic policy in mortal fear of significant reforms</li>
<li>A population that calls for strong leadership</li>
<li>The necessary populist parties to heed this call, including Romney+ statements such as "what Japan needs now is dictatorship" or "women who live beyond their child-bearing years are useless and are committing a sin"</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/senkaku.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2111" title="senkaku" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/senkaku-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Luckily the leaders of the Japan Restoration Party, from whom these quotes are derived, lost a bit of momentum during the final weeks before the election and were unable to gain a significant electoral victory. Nevertheless, Japan’s crisis in confidence might still have unwanted consequences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to gain the upper hand, Shinzo Abe of the opposition-part LDP has pulled the nationalist card on the issue of the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/world-asia-pacific-11341139">Senkaku/Diaoyu</a> islands. Even though the DPJ-government recently scrambled fighter jets to defend their territorial integrity, Abe stands for an explicit <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/world-asia-20722641">‘tough stance’</a> vis-à-vis the Chinese claims.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given some of his earlier foreign policy statements, one can only wonder what taking such a stronger position would entail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abe is notoriously unforthcoming when WWII issues are brought to the table, as he denied many of the Japanese crimes committed on the Asian mainland and supports the revoking of  1990’s apology related to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So although Japan’s situation looks very similar to the crisis on the old continent, the geopolitical risks are much larger. European nationalism is mainly  inward-looking, implying that the consequences of such policies would be felt within Europe itself. Japanese nationalism on the other hand seems oriented towards the exterior, largely due to its position near a rising giant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/world-asia-20747496"> first exit-polls</a> it seems that the LDP has won a clear majority. Abe had only one major weakness, as he  repeatedly defended Japan’s continued need for nuclear energy. In the end, it seems that his nationalist program took the upper hand over the environmantal concerns many Japanese have.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reactions after these results were quite clear. Chinese media immediately warned that an "economically weak and politically angry Japan will not only hurt the country, but also hurt the region and the world at large". Indeed, if both the new Chinese government and Abe would stick to their national and ‘tough’ policy promisses, options for resolving the dispute will narrow down significantly.</p>
