<p style="text-align: justify;">Freshly minted with holiday loot, today we ask you to think before you frock. In fashion, like in the rest of our world, there are few things that haven't been done.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In beauty or glamour, people often experiment with remixing looks from the past. Things that were glamorous. A time that was beautiful when captured in still, black &amp; white <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/?q=marilyn">images</a>. A place we can never hope to understand, no matter how many vinyl records we collect or how many Manhattans served by suspender-clad bartenders we pretend to sip.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Glamour, of any sort, is both external and deliberate. It is a choice to model yourself in the image of the person that you want to be, as opposed to the person you are. Isn't that wonderful? In a world of sheep, followers, the 99% what could possibly be right about fitting in? But <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/hipster.html">our generation</a> seems stuck. Following in the evolutionary pattern of our forefathers, we've done away with the hallmarks of their entrapments. The 9 to 5 is no longer economically viable, God is mostly dead, and life is so damn fragile. And we haven't figured out what we're left with. A five-year plan? We could barely scrape together a five-day plan — even if you paid us, which we <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/business/03intern.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">expect</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The beautiful and tormented <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Carson_McCullers">Carson McCullers</a> wrote, “We are torn between nostalgia for the familiar and an urge for the foreign and strange. As often as not, we are homesick most for the places we have never known.” With so many avenues for self-expression, the possibilities are <em>comme tu veux</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And yet, the once-great fashion houses now look to the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/colehaan.tumblr.com">street</a> for inspiration, who in turn look to the fashion houses, who look to the street, and everybody ends up in <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/we-are-irony/">non-prescription eyeglasses</a>. How to break this cycle of widespread cultural stagnation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Option 1: Wholly and completely tether your identity to your sartorial choices. Care about something and see it reflected in every facet of your being. Be willing to sacrifice the respect of generations past and maybe even future. Is it self-indulgent? Decidedly so. Does it hurt anyone? Of course not (well, that depends entirely on your <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/VfwcALFMEEo">mother</a>). Here I see mohawks, faux-hawks, and maybe even <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/define.php?term=Bro%20Hawk">bro-hawks</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Option 2: Try to do something noble (i.e. "fit in") on the grounds that we all crave an individuality that is basically (and logistically) hopeless and/or self-indulgent. This probably involves a uniform and ultimately a barcode of some kind. Think Hunger Games or just have a gander in your local Gap.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alternatively, you could climb to a somewhat deserted rooftop, bang your fists against your chest and shout at the top of your lungs, “I am NOT a hipster, and I am NOT mainstream!” and then <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ZsABTmT1_M0">treat yourself</a> to a cool-down at Starbucks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What do you, dear reader, think of the state of fashion today? What does it say about our culture? Where should it go from here? Let’s see some examples, people!</p>
