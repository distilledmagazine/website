<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Deny the problem and it will go away (Every person in the world with responsibility: politicians, leaders of business, even artists and cultural sector)’. When the Distilled editors were asked to give their views on what were the most important events and evolutions of 2012, this was one response that stood out. In its brief honesty, this phrase summarizes much of the past year and at the same time contains a well-known truth: closing your eyes is never going to help.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/report-quid-novum-2012/keep-calm-and-gangnam-style/" rel="attachment wp-att-2202"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2202" alt="keep-calm-and-gangnam-style" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/keep-calm-and-gangnam-style-218x300.jpg" width="218" height="300" /></a>The fact is that 2012 was a perfect year to close your eyes and pretend that everything is fine. The central trends we witnessed can barely be called new, as the issues that confronted the World this year dated back to 2011, 2008, and earlier. The solutions that were presented also cannot be considered innovative, adaptive, or thorough.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One example is quite obvious, and has been heartfelt by almost every American. Only two weeks ago, a single man took an assault rifle to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/world-us-canada-20738998">Sandy Hook Elementary School</a>, Newtown, Connecticut. Twenty children and six adults died for no apparent reason. Five months earlier, a gunman killed 12 people during a screening of the new Batman-film in <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/world-us-canada-18996026">Aurora</a>, Colorado. The Columbine incident already dates back to 1999, but the death toll demanded by America’s fourth amendment has only increased. Although president Obama <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/entertainment-arts-20782805">promised</a> to deal at least with weapons designed for war, the current political climate still isn’t exactly favourable to such legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And to stay with the US, even the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/cartoon-election-lanes/">electoral ballot</a> seemed to be a badly disguised copy of 2008. Although Obama had a slow start during the debates, the essence of the competition remained the same: A charismatic Democrat supported by the US ‘minorities’ and virtually every country in the world (Israel excepted maybe) picked up the gauntlet against a crazy and incapable Republican stuck in his elitist policies. The <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/all-quiet-on-the-american-front/">campaigns</a> were big and became even bigger, the media was polarized and became even more polarized. Obama’s victory speech was as hopeful as four years ago, but didn’t have the same ring to it. ‘Yes We Can’ might have been refreshing, but ‘Forward’ heralded that we will see more of the same in the future. Compared to what we might have gotten with Romney as president most people won’t grief for this continuity, although Obama will have to face numerous problems he could not fix during his first term. If we had not heard the term ‘<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/the-fiscal-blip/">fiscal cliff</a>’ last year, we would wonder what it was.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other political events also did not deliver significant change. The Arab Spring was something completely new in 2011, but it failed to consolidate in 2012. Libya still runs the risk of being torn apart by clan feuds, whereas Egypt apparently elected a new pharaoh. In another part of the Middle-East, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/aria-of-the-flying-rockets/">Israel and Hamas</a> simply continued their rocket- and airstrike-fuelled dispute, just as <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/report-crisis-in-north-kivu-a-deja-vu/">Congo and Rwanda</a> had a re-run of their own conflict. Please do not ask whether the UN had a new strategy towards these issues. Moving to Asia, the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/crisis-for-the-young-dynamic-democracy-of-taiwan/">Taiwanese Kuomintang</a> safely remained in power, and the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/an-inconvenient-coverage/">new Chinese leadership</a> doesn’t hold the promise of a rapid turnaround in Chinese politics. Similarly, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/the-beauty-the-beast-and-photographic-evidence/">Putin</a> might have had a bit of a rough ride during his elections but he remains safely in the tsarist seat. In Spain, despite the growing force of nationalism, the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/four-dreams-and-a-status-quo/">Basques</a> remained part of Spain, as did the Scots in the UK. France changed its right-wing president for a left-wing leader, only to announce that Europe safely stays on the course set by Angela Merkel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amongst this electoral (and not so electoral) governmental continuity the major issues of the previous years remained unaddressed. First and foremost, the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/an-inconvenient-coverage/">Doha Climate Conference</a> delivered the expected result, which is to say, no result at all. Amongst ever fading public interest our glaciers and poles continue to melt, our rivers and seas stay polluted, our ecological footprint continues to expand. Not for the first time a superstorm demonstrated that even the richer countries will suffer the consequences of inaction, although not every politician will mourn about the opportunities it presents for showing leadership during electoral times. Secondly, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/individualism-is-bad-for-business/">no important shift</a> has rocked our economic fibre. The <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/the-confusions-of-young-anonymous/">Occupy</a>-movement died out, and the people who happily greased their purses remain part of our financial and industrial elite. As far as I know, no culprit has been punished and the system as it existed <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/no-end-to-the-panic/">remains solidly in place</a>, albeit supported by the austerity measures issued during previous years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So were we then at least able to produce something new in the field of sports, culture, and science? <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/modern-glamour/">Not really</a>. <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/ghosts-of-new-olympia/">The Olympics</a> went well, but nobody expected them to surpass the Beijing games. Everything about them was nice, but they didn’t blow us away as China did four years earlier. And if we are fair to ourselves, we knew all along that there was something peculiar about <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/uk-england-kent-20154327">Lance Armstrong</a>’s seven victories in the Tour de France. On the internet, we had the proliferation of Oppa Gangnam Style as a demonstration of the ever further possibilities of mass media, although one can wonder whether it will become a crucial part of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/watch?v=lJtHNEDnrnY&amp;t=3m13s">Noam Chomsky’s oeuvre</a>. One other new cultural feature was the much-debated (both at universities and in hair salons) <i><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/entertainment-arts-17768823">50 Shades of Grey</a></i> trilogy, the effects of which seem to be as long-lasting as a sailor returning home after 3 months at sea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, in the field of science we were spared of great new inventions, the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/japanese-man-invents-bin-moving_n_1697354.html">Self-Propelled Garbage Bin</a> not included. That it soon will be possible to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/9770565.stm">print your own bicycle</a> we already knew, and the discovery of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Higgs_boson">Higgs-Boson</a> was predicted in 1960. Scientists veered up when they heard that something had moved <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/science-environment-17139635">faster than light</a>, but even this basic impossibility of physics was confirmed as the measurements proved incorrect. Agreed, the successful landing of <i><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/index.html">Curiosity</a></i> on Mars was a nice event, but it isn’t the first time we have put earthly creations on or red neighbour. The most unique part of this story is that <i>Curiosity</i> has worked flawless so far, but NASA managed to spoil this novelty by announcing its next ‘<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/health-20592018">big-but-actually-rather-disappointing</a>’ discovery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You might consider this year of continuity something positive after years of bad news. Isn’t the fact that nothing serious happened a sign that the implemented policies actually work? Doesn’t it mean that we can continue on the road ahead without compromising our current stability and wealth?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As 21 December has proven, it is impossible to predict the future and so no attempt will be made here. Maybe we have solved or contained some of our problems in 2012. Maybe we have failed to do so. Maybe we have ignored new difficulties or created additional troubles through our current policies. Only 2013 will tell. But what remains true, even in a year of which the trend was that there was no trend, is that sticking your head in the sand will never work. So one thing at least can be predicted: during the next year, Distilled will continue to ask for your views, your opinions, and your beliefs, as we will force you to stake your case and defend it. Wisely.</p>
