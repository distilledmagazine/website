<p style="text-align: justify;">If you happened to walk between the snowy trees of the Thuringian forest on Christmas Eve 1934, you might have seen an interesting sight: a group of enthusiastic Zionists, dancing around a Christmas tree. A strange sight indeed. If you happened to be Jewish, Germany was hardly a good place to be in 1934. Nevertheless, there they were. Dancing around their tree. What were they doing, and <em>Why?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, if they had been <em>Wandervogel-jugend</em>, it would have been understandable. These dancers would have been romantic middle-class enthusiastic German youths, trying to get in touch with nature again, by weekend hiking, earnest mountainside discussions, campfire chants and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wandervoegel+-+Explaining+Hitler+-+Occult+History+Third+Reich+-+Peter+Crawford.png">nudist sun worshipping</a>. (Sadly, the First World War had greatly decimated the ranks of this youth movement.) But as said, these weren’t wander-birds; they weren’t reciting Stefan George and they certainly weren’t dancing naked. They were Zionists. But why then were they so happy?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The last two years had brought nothing but uncertainty and fear for the German Jews, from the smearing of the Star of David on Berlin shop windows to collective boycotts of Jewish trade, and the voting of laws that restricted Jewish access to the civil service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/dancing-around-the-tree/ruppberg-mountain-zella-mehlis-thuringian-forest-germany/" rel="attachment wp-att-2373"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2373" alt="Ruppberg Mountain - Zella-Mehlis, Thuringian Forest, Germany" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Ruppberg-Mountain-Zella-Mehlis-Thuringian-Forest-Germany.png" width="274" height="168" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Needless to say most of the Jews weren’t dancing at Christmas eve 1934. “Wait and see,” most of them said, while their leaders endlessly discussed how their “future” would look like in the third Reich. As the liberal era of legally protected rights slowly disappeared together with what was left of the Weimar Republic, some Jews became convinced that Germany was still the only place for them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of them was Hans-Joachim Schoeps, who happened to be walking in the Thuringian forest on Christmas Eve 1934. He and his <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Der_deutsche_Vortrupp._Gefolgschaft_deutscher_Juden">German Vanguard</a> — his group of German Jews who felt they belonged to Germany — were having a 'leadership session' to expand their ranks and refine their message for Jewish youths. Schoeps found out that a group of enthusiastic Zionists was dancing around a tree in the village.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Incensed, he raced to the home of the local Nazi Sturmbannführer, a cobbler, and woke him at three in the morning by pounding on his door. Schoeps apologized profusely for the Zionists' behaviour to this bleary eyed and dumbfounded Nazi functionary, handed him some leaflets about the German Vanguard, and melted back into the wintry night.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile the Jews kept on dancing. Anti-Semitism was growing and the Nazis were becoming more powerful everyday. It became more clear to the Jewish communities that the Schoepses of this world were wrong to think the Jews were as much home as they could ever be. The Nazi’s legal definition of the Jews as a distinct race had unified them more than all the work of unity-minded Jewish intellectuals could ever have done.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When this finally dawned to Schoeps, he fled his beloved Germany. Four years after the night in the Thuringian forest, and just before being arrested by the Gestapo, his plane soared northward, leaving behind the twinkling lights of Berlin where millions of Germans were peacefully – for the last time in many years - gathered around their candlelit Christmas trees.</p>
