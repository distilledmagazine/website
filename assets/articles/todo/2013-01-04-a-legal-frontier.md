<p style="text-align: justify;">America’s infatuation with firearms is something that needs to be discussed. It is a distinct part of our identity, and yet, we seem to be unable to own them in such a way that prevents us from frequently killing one another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Newtown shooting was a wake up call for the United States. It underscored the importance of us being honest with ourselves, and working diligently as a nation to ensure that tragedies like Newtown are not the norm. There is no silver bullet answer to the culture of violence that is currently so pervasive in the United States. We do however know some clear policy steps that can be taken immediately in order to work to remedy these deep, systemic problems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Owning and operating a car is more strictly regulated in the United States than owning a gun. Both are machines capable of killing humans. One of them however was solely invented in order to destroy a living thing.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/a-legal-frontier/sandy_hook_memorial/" rel="attachment wp-att-2412"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2412" alt="Sandy_Hook_Memorial" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Sandy_Hook_Memorial.png" width="267" height="185" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This does not mean that we should abolish the private ownership of firearms. It does mean though, that we need to take that simple, undeniable fact into account when writing policies surrounding ownership.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like owning and operating a car, firearms are a distinct part of the American identity. Both are intertwined with our culture of freedom, and the unconquered frontier. Many of us do not live in those landscapes anymore though. We live in urban or suburban settings, where you cannot simply go in your backyard and shoot your gun with impunity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It does not make sense for everyone in a crowded city to be allowed to carry a concealed weapon. Changing basic policies to make gun ownership something that is not gone into lightly, would help create a culture in which gun ownership is a rite of passage — not the acquisition of a toy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We probably will never be able to fully stop gun tragedies. Even European countries with low records of gun violence have massacres like Dunbane and Oslo. On the whole though, these countries have much less recorded gun crimes than the United States.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is time that the US acknowledges it has a problem, so we work together as a nation to fix it. This will not come easy. It will entail a variety of changes beyond better gun policies — like investing in mental health programs, and creating a culture that doesn’t glorify violence. The sooner we identify the problem, the sooner we will be able to move beyond this horrific cancer that has infected us.</p>
