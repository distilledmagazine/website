<p style="text-align: justify;">When one thinks of populism, what usually comes to mind is some form of far-left or far-right movement. Populist movements often ride the coattails of a charismatic leader, standing up during an economic crisis. The left blames unchecked capitalism, while the right whips up false memories of a bygone era devoid of everything from foreigners to gays to atheists. Both are rising on either side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the U.S. the Tea Party is a perfect example, combining social conservatism with laissez-faire economics. It has a counterpart on the left in Occupy Wall Street, a largely socially progressive movement scornful of bankers and company big wigs. Both assert that the country has been taken over by elites, either in the form of “socialist” politicians or corporate fat cats and it is time to give it back to regular people. Almost according to script, we see a similar pattern in Greece, where the fascist Golden Dawn and  far-left Syriza have both capitalized on widespread economic malaise and discontent, despite supporting radically different ideologies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One thing modern populist parties don't tend to be is liberal. Historically, liberalism is after all the policy of the establishment, rooted in the Lockean and Millean ideals of the 19th-century European bourgeoisies.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Plik:Palikot.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-2438"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2438" title="Januzs Palikot with gun and dildo" alt="Palikot" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Palikot.jpg" width="270" height="257" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is an exception though in one of the unlikeliest places: Poland.  Named after its leader Janusz Palikot — and what could be more populist than naming your party after yourself? — Palikot’s Movement is broadly liberal. They caused a stir in the 2011 Polish parliamentary election by gaining 10 percentage points of the vote, placing third.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whereas Poland often has a reputation of being a traditionally catholic and conservative country, Palikot ran on a platform that included measures aimed at breaking the power of the catholic church, legalizing cannabis and allowing gay marriage. On the economic side, the liberal line remains with Palikot himself a keen advocate of free-market policies, like deregulation and a flat tax.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is not the positions of the party that make it populist however but rather the antics of its leader.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Palikot was still a member of the centrist Citizen’s Platform, he brought attention to alleged rape by police officers in the city of Lublin by brandishing a dildo and a gun at a press conference. As a member of his own party, he attempted to smoke a joint inside parliament before ultimately opting to light a stick of incense when it became clear he would be arrested. And his party went all out to protest the adoption of ACTA by the Polish government when they donned Guy Fawkes masks inside the chamber.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Much of Palikot’s support comes from the Polish youth and it’s not hard to see why. If populism is supposed to be the cause of the common people vs. an out of touch elite, there is perhaps no greater ideological chasm than the generation gap. After all, youth around the world tend to support the same kind of social policies as Palikot’s Party. And while they generally tend to be more leftist when it comes to the economy, in Poland a distrust of socialism runs deep, helping garner support for the party’s laissez-faire approach.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For all his curiosities, Palikot neatly fits into a political space that was open for the taking.</p>
