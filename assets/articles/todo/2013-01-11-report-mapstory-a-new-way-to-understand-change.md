<p style="text-align: justify;">With ever larger parts of the world available for exploration, mapping foreign spaces has become increasingly important. Over centuries, people have created and used maps to make their environment accessible, and to create a feeling of security about where they are and where they are going. Through the “Geospatial Revolution”, including things such as location-enabled mobile devices and commercial satellite imagery, we now have reached the pinacle of such endeavors: anyone can now locate his or her position almost to the inch.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2467" alt="map" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/map-300x204.jpg" width="300" height="204" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But maps allow us to do much more than just navigate our way around the planet. Exactly as was the aim of the earliest maps, we also chart spaces in order to make them understandable. Having the entirety of the United States of America on a single piece of paper will not provide you with a location; it rather helps you visualize a situation by providing clarification through simplification. However, so far maps have had one major problem. Because they are essentially two-dimensional, it is very hard to apply them to complex topics. How do you accurately depict change with a tool as sturdy as a flat image? Or maybe even more important, how do you tell the story that lies behind the map?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is where <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mapstory.org">MapStory</a> comes in. Recently founded by social entrepreneur Christopher Tucker, this US-based non-profit organization has made it its mission to rethink the world of map-making. Distilled Extra saw the opportunity to interview Jonathan Marino, Director of Content and Strategy at MapStory, and returned with an interesting view on the power of this new world of charting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first question one might ask is how it is possible to revolutionize the ancient world of map making. According to Marino ‘the goals of MapStory are twofold: one, to organize existing knowledge spatially and temporally rather than encyclopedically, and two, to really enable anyone, be it a student, teacher, or professional, to tap into this new mode of conveying stories. It tries to allow communities, at whatever level, to organise their knowledge about the world based on something else than topics or keywords.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘This is based on the larger philosophical notion that pretty much everything in human life happens in the context of two things, namely space and time’ says Marino, ‘upon that anvil we can really forge understanding about anything, anywhere, anytime’. For MapStory it is indeed a central goal to reorganise knowledge according to more natural categories. ‘People still live their lives somewhere, so it relates to the way human beings innately think. An encyclopaedic organization of knowledge is really developed for the knowledge itself. Spatial thinking on the other hand allows you to organize it around yourself’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But as Marino himself notes, changing this general way of thinking is a daunting task as people are very acquainted to standard categorization. ‘Of course we work with some topics, which is a hard thing to do’ he admits. ‘Developing a taxonomy which really incorporates all knowledge about the world is rather difficult, but by allowing you to search by time, place and storyteller we can nevertheless add a whole new dimension’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another central component to MapStory is the idea that maps can tell stories. But how can a simple map transfer the same knowledge and creativity as a text of 300 pages? ‘First of all, I love books’ confirms the director, ‘so my great hope is that we don’t create a juxtaposition with the classical book. We want to create a connection to longer form research, and in the end we might even be able to bring back to live some older empirical work that is hiding in a library somewhere’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In practice this narrative approach translates into three layers, those of storytellers, story layers, and mapstories. ‘This second category is simply what for decades has been considered as geospatial data’ explains Marino. ‘But this is just one layer of a story; the narrative comes in when you start to place multiple layers over each other. Then you get an additional perspective’. So what would such a story look like? ‘Stories will add things such as annotations, multimedia, drop-in options, and the connections to more classical content. But as of yet this side needs to be still further developed’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although all these additions sound like they require a strong technical component, MapStory is surprisingly flexible and open to use. Marino is particularly proud of the software they are currently using and expanding. ‘We are constructing the project upon something called the GeoNode, which is developed by a non-profit called OpenGeo. All the code is open source and any developer can build on it’. And apparently this does not hinder the development of innovative mapstories. ‘The things happening with geospatial data right now are pretty exciting, and potentially provocative. You are talking about 2-D imagery, we are working with 3-D. Now it is all raster data, we are working on vector data’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘But still we need to be clear and honest about the limits of what mapping can do’ Marino admits. There are indeed limits to what one can do with charts, and the MapStory team will need to address the inherent problems of maps within the coming months. ‘I worry a lot about what is called the ecological fallacy’, says Marino, ‘whereby things look connected but aren’t. And there are of course the potential misuses of geospatial data and privacy problems’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides resorting to a strongly peer-controlled environment in order to guarantee quality, the consensus has therefore been that MapStory is about historical data and avoids referring to living individuals who are not public figures. But that absolutely doesn’t diminish Marino’s belief in the changes that MapStory can bring to teaching and learning. ‘MapStory is about perspective sharing. Maps have always claimed to be objective, but they aren’t. And exactly because of this, we want to be honest about that fact and expand the perspective as far as possible. And that is why the narrative component is so important to us’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So in a world of continuous change, it seems that <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mapstory.org">MapStory</a> will become a place of reflection for young people who want to visualize their environment. The project taps into an intellectual vein based on the notion of individual stories in a globalized world, and with that it has the potential to grow significantly. If the project manages to keep the technology accessible and the stories sensible, we will probably see the first mapstories make their way into public debate in the next few years.</p>
