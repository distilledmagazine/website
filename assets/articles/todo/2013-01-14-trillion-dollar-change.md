<blockquote><p>The issue, for those who need a refresher: To avoid running into the debt ceiling in the next couple of months, the Treasury secretary could exploit a legal loophole, create a platinum coin, assign it a value of $1 trillion or some other very high number, and deposit it at the Fed, thus enabling the government to carry out its previously promised tax and spending policies without broaching the legal cap on debt issuance.</p>
<p>This idea is positively idiotic, though it has gained a more and more respectable set of fans....Some of the critics are misunderstanding what it would do and wouldn’t do. The fact that it is idiotic is kind of the point.</p></blockquote>
