<p style="text-align: justify;">When you earn the<a href="http://www.namibian.com.na/news/full-story/archive/2013/january/article/afghan-taliban-condemn-french-military-intervention-in-mali/"> condemnation of the Taliban</a>, you are doing something right. While the Sahel region is unlikely to be stable any time soon, there is very little reason to believe that the <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/files/element_multimedia/image/Mali%20map%20EN.jpg" target="_blank">French presence in Mali</a> will be a protracted one. Simply put, there is a legitimacy to the action that was not present in Iraq, Afghanistan, or even Libya. Instead it resembles far more the French support to Ivorian president Alassane Ouattara during what is hyperbolically called that country’s second civil war in 2011. That conflict began in February of that year and was finished before the end of March.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Côte d'Ivoire and Mali share two important things in common: the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) supported both; and both happened in former French West African states still firmly in the French sphere of influence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The regional governance of West Africa is a remarkable political creature. It has similar origins and instruments to the European project. It’s a dual entity serving economic interests and seeking to maintain regional peace. To that end, the French-speaking countries of West Africa share a currency (pegged to the Euro), the West African Franc, and the entire region has a strong interest in being perceived as stable. So it's no surprise that ECOWAS didn't hesitate to begin collecting troops to support the French-led mission, providing the necessary legitimacy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This, along with the fact that Bamako invited France, changes everything.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which is where we arrive at point number two. Mali is a former French colony; the people speak French, buy French products, the elite study in French institutions and football fans follow the French league and often enough even support <em>Les Bleus</em>. Qualitatively, the situation is nothing like Afghanistan where there could not be a wider cultural distance between the US and locals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More to the point, France is seen in its former colonies as playing a much more paternal role. Whereas Europe as a whole has been a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/watch?v=MGQaH3-LK54" target="_blank">net consumer of security goods</a> since the World War II, France is largely a security provider in the less developed corners of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Francophonie" target="_blank"><em>La Francophonie</em></a>. They have an interest in doing so because they are maintaining the only viable, centralised but international language entity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The result is that many people who do not speak French simply do not know much about the French world because it is able to survive flying under the English world's radar. This is difficult to explain, but Canadians (and Cameroonians) are among the few who understand the importance of whether you write currency symbols before or after amounts. The “English-speaking world”, Latin America, Middle East, and CIS are just not comparable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The only reason it is important to understand not understanding the French world, is that the relationship between France and its former colonies is an integral part of this. While Algeria and Vietnam were catastrophes, Europe would not have an<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Europe_s_Spaceport2"> equitorial space centre</a> were it not for residual French colonial habits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After learning from the mistakes of the past, France stands to be an excellent partner to ECOWAS as West Africa becomes more militarily and economically viable on its own. In time this will happen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping democracy in Côte d'Ivoire and the Taliban out of Mali is key to West African development. That is the<em> fil rouge</em> the two incidents share. They represent the emerging effectiveness of a unique West African governance model, and a hope for the first globally participatory part of Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
