<p style="text-align: justify;">Sexuality has the strange quality that it arouses and excites people. Strange and previously unknown emotions suddenly flare up, and very often we see a side of ourselves we didn’t want to see. Sometimes it even escalates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently a violent rape in India resulted in a massive demonstration in Delhi and responses of outrage from all over the world. Some people however, make a strange turn in their condemnations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ian Buruma for example, <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/pope-benedict-xvi-s-misguided-view-of-sexual-dangers-by-ian-buruma" target="_blank">manages to blame the pope</a> for the violent rape in India. In his argument, the recent <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20121221_auguri-curia_en.html" " target="_blank">papal defense of the family</a> is not only a direct attack on same-sex unions, it is foremost an attempt to restrict sexual behavior, from its apparent natural, free state, to a state of repression and fear. Not sex itself, but the attempt to repress it — by popes and rabbis and people like that — is the cause of all escalations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ian Buruma uses an argument of remarkable simplicity. Sex is good in nature, and should be free; all evil involved results from the attempts to contain it. “The more sex is repressed and people are made to fear it the greater the chance of sexual violence."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/the-innocense-of-sexuality/sexuality/" rel="attachment wp-att-2547"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2547" alt="sexuality" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/sexuality.jpg" width="269" height="179" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, it is not this argument itself that makes this column so interesting, but the length to which Buruma is willing to go in his defense of the innocence of sexuality. Why is it so important for him to prove his point, that he has to seek his evidence all the way in the suburbs of Delhi? Is it because he can’t find religious rapists in Europe? Or is it because they belong to the wrong religion?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also last week, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/world-europe-21004322" target="_blank">hundreds of thousands of protesters took</a> to the streets of Paris over plans to give gay couples in France the right to marry and adopt children. Religious groups were of course part of it, but so were secular, agnostic, and humanist groups. The protestors were varied and multicultural, but mostly young couples that weren’t there to defend their religious values.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, this issue goes deeper than the differences between religion and secular society. What brought all these people together was a refusal to believe in the innocence of sex.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite all attempts of society to make people accept this innocence as a given — including a multi-billion dollar porn-industry that would make the Marquis De Sade blush — people are still clever enough to realize that sex simply arouses too much excitement to be innocent. You can try and deal with this excitement by simply blaming the pope for a gang-rape in Delhi, or you can try to understand it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But claiming that it is misplaced fear of an in itself innocent sexuality that made all these hundreds of thousands to protest is both ridiculous and offensive, certainly if you add that it is this fear that is the cause of all sexual violence. Did these people went home afterwards to beat up their women? Or engaged in violent group rapes? If that had happened, Buruma may have actually had a point.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One thing is for sure though, whoever is right, whatever laws the governments of this world pass, sexuality will always stir excitement.</p>
