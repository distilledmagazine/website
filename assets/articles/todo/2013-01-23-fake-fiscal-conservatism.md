<p style="text-align: justify;">Remember when conservatives believed in the free market? Through privatisation  deregulation, and lower taxes, conservatives in the United States and Britain preached that the free market would bring prosperity that would trickle down to benefit the entire society. The government had no business regulating or running industries because only a competitive market knew best.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now we come to debts and deficits, an issue that is in fact new to the conservative playbook. In the 2000 presidential primaries, Republicans were debating whether the government should keep its surplus in a "lockbox" or use it to fund the Bush tax cuts, putting money back into the hands of American taxpayers and causing a deficit. At the time, it was the conservative position that a surplus would threaten the economy by paying the government debt down too soon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fast forward to a new era and the conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic are demanding immediate debt reduction even in times of a struggling economy. Why must we reduce our debt now, when it was not a priority just a decade ago? David Cameron explains: "If you borrow too much, you just build up debts for your children to pay off. You put at risk your economy. That's the case in Britain."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Borrowing "too much" will put pressure on interest rates and put the economy at risk. That seems safe enough; doing too much of anything is tautologically bad, or else it would not be too much. The question is how much debt is too much. Britain has had a long history with national debt, reaching proportional peaks of 288% of GDP in 1821 and over 261% of GDP in 1945 (<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Stockholm_reconstructed.pdf">Ritschl 1996</a>, p. 21). What makes now the time that it is too much and that interest rates are likely to spike <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2-24102012-AP-EN.PDF">when debt to GDP is a third of those peaks at 86%</a>?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It seems that conservatives should look to the private market, the institution that is supposed to be their all-knowing source of information. The private market shows record-low interest rates in Britain, the US, Switzerland, Japan, and pretty much every country that has debt denominated in its own, self-controlled currency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Only countries in the eurozone, with no control over their currency, have seen interest rates rise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After seeing record-low rates around 2% for 10-year and 3% for 30-year bonds in both countries, prominent conservatives such as Lindsey Graham conclude that the US could be the next Greece if it does not get its debt in order soon. Market experts are locking their money in at 3% interest for 30 years, while conservatives now believe that an interest rate spike (that would cause these buyers major losses) is just around the corner. Conservatives incite panic, while the market signals no danger. Perhaps the private market is not the fountain of information that conservatives were claiming.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What we are seeing is the exposure of a fraud. When believing in the wisdom of the private market meant smaller government and lower taxes/restrictions on the rich, then the private market was gospel. When the situation changed such that the argument for smaller government required moving exactly opposite the wisdom of the private market, fake fiscal conservatism continues pushing smaller government. The economic argument is merely a pawn; conservative priorities lie elsewhere.</p>
