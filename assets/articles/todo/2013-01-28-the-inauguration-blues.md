<p style="text-align: justify;">The President’s second inauguration, while a time of fervent celebration for many, brought for me a pang of sadness. It wasn’t that I was sad about Obama’s victory. Having a Democratic President, although a painfully centrist one, makes me much happier than the alternative. My sadness stems from knowing that this centrist President is the best that we can do as a country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This President. The one who has deported more undocumented immigrants than President George W. Bush. The one who authorized increased drone strikes in Pakistan and other Middle Eastern countries, while allegedly “ending” the war in Iraq. The one who has entreated our society to address the impending threat of climate change, while offering tacit approval for the Keystone XL Pipeline. This President is the best we can do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, it brings a tear to my eye to think of having someone other than President Obama as my President. As disappointing as his politics may be at times, I can’t stand the thought of him leaving in four years. President Obama does a lot of things wrong. Even though I have rarely fully agreed with any proposal or decision he has made over the last four years, he was the first President that I felt like I could relate to as a human being.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">President Obama in many ways exemplifies the liberal ideals embodied by 1960’s America. He embodies the great strides towards racial, gender, and other types of social equality have been made over the past 50 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are by no means finished with that fight though. One realm of injustice that has seemed to only further deteriorate during this time has been that of income inequality. Wages and earnings were actually better for middle class families fifty years ago than they are today, with more and more Americans clinging to the lower edges of the middle class.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That the Obama administration, the Presidency of the Great Recession, has done largely nothing to address this issue, is an outrage. America is weary of the privileged white male frame from which we have chosen our leaders for the past 235 years or so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">President Obama has a real opportunity to lift up working and middle class families through his policies, while continuing to make strides in the arena of social justice. And yet, the progress made here has been largely frustrating. This leaves many progressives in America simultaneously euphoric and dejected by Obama’s Presidency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thankfully, having a person of color as President has helped to shift the frame away from solely white males, but I think there is a real risk that this could turn into an anomaly. The question then is how do we move forward after this? How do we move forward after having a President that actually grew up like much of America, one who represents the shifting demographics of our country?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we progress into 2013, and the final term of Obama’s Presidency, I hope for two things. I hope that Obama stands with the everyday America from whence he came, as the opportunity to confront critical issues such as gun violence, immigration, and climate change present themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But most of all I hope that we as a society work together to ensure that President Obama is not a fluke, but rather the beginning of a shift in American politics.</p>
