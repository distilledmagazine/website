<p style="text-align: justify;">Please allow me to take this time to announce how chagrined I am that Chris Hughes has ruined <em>The New Republic</em>. <em>The New Republic</em> is a political and arts commentary magazine that has graced newsstands continuously since its first issue in November 1914. With 98 years of “modern liberal work”, it has proved an important cornerstone in educating and questioning political and societal norms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Being a longtime purveyor of its wares, I was considerably saddened and frustrated when Jonathan Chait, journalist, author, and former Senior Editor of <em>TNR</em> left in the fall of 2011. However, <em>The New York Magazine</em> did pick itself up a new reader in the process... Yet it had remained a very respectable publication.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The magazine was bought in March 2012, by Chris Hughes, of the Facebook co-founding variety of wealthy, upwardly mobile young idealists.  The unveiling of the new look, website, and app on Monday, left me astonished and baffled. The layout and format are stark and reminiscent of a college social group’s website, to my somewhat trained eye; it looks like the mobile version of a website on steroids. The centralized panel and three main groupings of content in the header, erode the former user-friendliness and ease of the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">I find it difficult to even finish reading an article that I have been grazing for the past week now that it metamorphosed. I had to voice my opposition aloud to a colleague: "The new <em>TNR</em> looks like a Chris Hughes bastardization of <em>TMZ</em>!" The instant realization that I had never visited <em>TMZ</em> posed a problem. Research in the field ensued...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I'm uncertain whether all this was a known known, a known unknown, or an unknown unknown when Al Gore decided to invent the internet: the embedded video URLs, live-streaming of Lindsay Lohan's latest trial, Bill Clinton keeping his pimp hand strong in a picture with NBA champions LeBron James and Dwayne Wade, entitled "Bill Clinton is an Honorary Brother", and even Hulk Hogan oiling up his daughter's ass...  but <em>TMZ</em> still wins. Well, the layout wars anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a near doubling of <em>The New Republic’</em>s staff since Hughes’s purchase, the content has not yet degraded to <em>TMZ</em>’s trivial internet and celebrity banalities. However, I am tickled that Vanilla Ice has "got some hot real estate tips" for me. Thank you, Warner Bros., for providing this resource to the world, jellying the minds of readers since 2005.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I still view the internet as a privilege. But dressed in virtual canonical robes, supposedly ordained by the masses, informative websites are pandering to younger crowds with gossip, tabloid page layouts, and a dizzying amount of sensationalized journalism (Newsweek, here’s lookin’ at you kid).  It is a difficult time for general interest publications. I remain neutral with my thoughts whether Jonathan Cohn and Timothy Noah can keep <em>TNR</em> away from this general trend.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I dreamed a dream of how modern liberal opinions and commentary would continue to be served up by the old <em>The New Republic</em>. While I might personally feel as affronted as Anne Hathaway in her searing and heart-wrenching song in Les Miserables, it remains unknown if this is a storm that <em>The New Republic</em> can weather or if Chris Hughes has killed the dream in me.</p>
