<p style="text-align: justify;">If you listen to comparisons between the US and Europe, it is often a tale of a nation driven by free markets, competition and personal responsibility, as opposed to a continent with vast welfare states, high taxes and socialist tendencies. And while all stereotypes are exaggerations at best, this idea has been woven into the collective imagination. The US is capitalist, Europe is socialist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a great irony then that when it comes to sport this entire narrative is flipped on its head. Europe’s football leagues are dominated by a ruthless free market where rich owners can spend truckloads of money in the pursuit of top talent and silverware. Most leagues around the continent will also have a few chosen powerhouses, while the minnows fight desperately to avoid being relegated year after year. In the survival of the fittest that is European sport, if you are not good enough you forfeit your place to sit at the top table.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Success on the other hand is handsomely rewarded with the best clubs receiving lucrative revenues from advancing in cup competitions. The team that wins this year’s Champions League will get a €10.5m payout.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Compare this to American sports where everything possible is done to ensure fairness and equality when it comes to competition. For instance, many top divisions such as the National Hockey League and the National Basketball Association implement strict salary caps designed to guarantee that wages across the league do not surpass a predetermined level.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This makes it very difficult to “stack” a team with superstars in the way teams such as Barcelona, Real Madrid and Chelsea have done on the old continent. In this way, these caps ensure a level of equality unseen in Europe by making sure no team has a major financial advantage. As for teams that do finish poorly, they need not fear relegation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the contrary, smaller teams are often rewarded with a higher draft pick for next season’s competition. In America, the draft is the only way for young new players to enter many leagues. So by giving weaker teams first dibs, the league can ensure a more equal and competitive playing field for next year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Europe has no such mechanism and instead clubs engage in a free for all when it comes to signing new players. Those with the deepest pockets are most likely to win out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps the greatest example though comes from American football where the NFL actually splits the revenue it obtains from TV contracts equally between the clubs. Not only this, but ticket sales to matches are also split 60-40 between the home team and the opposition. For a sport that is as stereotypically American as apple pie and Chevrolet, this comes off as quite a surprise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">American talking heads may like to lecture Europeans on capitalism. But when it comes to sports at least, it's  their cousins back in the old world who are the real champions of free market capitalism.</p>
