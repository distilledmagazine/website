<p>Hi everyone, Brecht here. I'm Managing Editor at Distilled, and tonight I'll be playing the role of professional European. This means a generally smug and annoying attitude to everything going on — welfare state: too weak, military: too strong, education: too non-existant — except from President Obama himself, cause he's such a great man! At least that's what our media tell us. Drones? Never heard of them before.</p>
