<p>President Obama saying that now is the time to get comprehensive immigration reform. Keeps talking boots on the ground and border security.</p>
<p>Can we please acknowledge that <a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/04/23/net-migration-from-mexico-falls-to-zero-and-perhaps-less/">immigration</a> from Mexico is net zero, maybe less? People don't want to come here as badly as we think they do.</p>
