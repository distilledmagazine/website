<p style="text-align: justify;">Football has always been best described in the simplest, most definite ways. As the Beautiful Game. As war. Or through <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/watch?v=ZfDA4pADaWo" target="_blank">the sheer disbelief of Sir Alex Ferguson, summed up in two powerful words</a>. But what was once romantically called <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/The_Simplest_Game">"The Simplest Game"</a>, has turned into multi-billion Euro petri dish of everything that seems to trouble our society, rife with corruption, shady moves and questionable ethics. A choice selection of this week’s headlines sum up the murkier sides that we’ve shruggingly come to accept: racism in the stadiums, allegations of corruption and bribery in Qatar’s successful bid to host the World Cup in 2022. Even the "feel-good story of the year", David Beckham’s move to filthy rich up-and-comers Paris Saint-Germain, –<i>zut alors!</i> – turned out to be <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/david-beckham-goes-on-le-minimum-1573350">a nifty little trick</a> to evade President Hollande’s steep taxes for the rich. All in the name of charity, you see.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/football-family.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3663 alignleft" alt="football-family" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/football-family.jpg" width="307" height="230" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest fiasco announced itself first thing Monday morning: still drowsy from the weekend’s <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/21209130">thrilling fixtures</a>, the game woke up to a loud, booming noise coming from The Hague. In a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/europol-investigation-football-matchfixing?INTCMP=SRCH" target="_blank">rabble-rousing press conference</a>, Europol director Rob Wainwright spoke of evidence that “more than 380” professional European matches had been fixed, ranging from the lower leagues up to the Champions League. The fixes involved “a total of 425 match officials, club officials, players and serious criminals” and generated over €8m in betting profits. It was, as Wainwright called it, “just the tip of the ice-berg”, thus painting a picture of the sport in the firm grip of shadowy underworld figures, operating from the Far East, bent on destroying the game by corrupting it for personal gains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just a few days later though, the hysteria and headline-grabbing sensationalism have already given way to shoulder-shrugging cynicism again. After all, this was hardly surprising news: match-fixing has been ever-present in Europe’s lower leagues for the past decade. And one couldn’t help but think that the alarmist tone in which Europol announced its findings, mainly served to finally put match-fixing back on FIFA’s agenda, considering the underwhelming nature of their findings. The profit made by this gambling ring is but a drop in the ocean for an Asian gambling industry whose worth Dutch investigative journalists Iwan van Duren and Tom Knipping estimate at 500 billion euros a year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reasons for the sheer indifference towards tackling one of the games’ crippling problems appear to be twofold. Firstly, there is a growing sense that match-fixing is impossible to tackle. Football’s governing bodies are not equipped to monitor every game played in Europe’s professional leagues, nor are they responsible for curbing the activities of crime syndicates that mainly operate out of Singapore. They can only act retro-actively, and sentences issued by its disciplinary committees don’t carry nearly enough weight to dissuade players, referees or managers from cheating either. Bets are not just being placed on goals scored or conceded, but on first throw-ins or first yellow cards being issued. If it’s nigh impossible to trace, why not make an extra buck on the side?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is where the second reason kicks in: namely, the sense that nothing wrong has been done. Ostracized members of the football family always tend to find their way back in, no matter how heinous their crime. When the Belgian league was shocked to its core in 2005 by match-fixing set up by Chinese businessman Ye Zheyun, Lierse SK’s coach Paul Put was found guilty of manipulating several games, earning close to a million Euro in illegal payments, and was subsequently banned from coaching roles in Belgium. The same Paul Put that guided the Burkina Faso national team to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/21339090">the finals of the Africa Cup</a> yesterday (despite the team ironically falling foul to some suspicious refereeing decisions).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Football’s lack of moral fibre, though, is something that can be laid on the doorstep of FIFA and UEFA, with its respective heavy-handed histories of backdoor politics and nifty pay-off packages. Consider the latest anecdote emerging about Qatar’s questionable winning bid to organize the World Cup in 2022. German magazine <i>Sport Bild</i> detail a meeting between UEFA–president Michel Platini, former French PM Nicolas Sarkozy, a Qatari emir and the directors of Paris Saint-Germain. The result? Platini, who at first had doubts over the Qatari bid, votes for them. The Qatari’s invest heavily in France’s football through PSG. And Platini’s son, Laurent, becomes the head of a Qatari investment group. If football’s leading figures don’t set the example in protecting the integrity of the sport, why should the average Sunday League footballer care?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Match-fixing is a worrying practice, but it is an unfortunate side-effect of crime syndicates clawing their way into a lucrative business. Maybe, if the “football family” – as FIFA’s Sepp Blatter proudly calls it – , wants a clean break from the malaise affecting the sport, a new ethical way of running the sport, it should look inwards first. Rinus Michels, the legendary Holland coach, is often credited as saying “football is war”. The original, lesser known quote is all the more poignant: <i>Professional football is something like war. Whoever behaves too properly, is lost.</i> A motto we’ve all seem to have taken too much to heart.</p>
