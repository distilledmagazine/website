<p style="text-align: justify;">Want to live forever? Unfortunately that's still as impossible as it has always been. What can survive indefinitely however is our species, and perhaps one day individuals as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These prospects depend on us. They depend on the collective efforts of subsequent generations; on the ability of those generations to recognise and overcome their own arrogance. If we are to survive we must know ourselves, and to know ourselves we must know other things. This is why I feel the need to respond to the scurrilities directed at my peers in academia scorned for pursuing “useless” degrees.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Gene_Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> once said it is a basic human need to understand "that the human race is improving; that we have things to be proud of as humans. No, ancient astronauts did not build the pyramids — human beings built them, because they're clever and they work hard." And that is exactly why we need to know these things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is why education should not be meant to simply satisfy the needs of the market. Consequently, the legitimacy and value of somebody’s life decisions should not depend on the marketability of the outcomes of those decisions. Making a social pariah out of a pre-modern history specialist because engineers are in demand at oil companies is counterproductive — contrary to what pop-economics may try to tell you . If we enlarge the time-scale of analysis, productivity stops when the species does.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, the pre-modern historian can tell you, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/history-society">paraphrasing Jared Diamond</a>, that “cultures fall as people fail to meet the challenges imposed by nature, as they misuse natural resources, and ultimately drift blindly beyond a point of no return". Developing fossil fuels ad nauseum will ensure ours follows suit; our planet is but Easter Island on a grander scale.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are always myriads of unexpected benefits to the potential exploration of a body of knowledge. It would be undignifying — if not tragically self-deceptive — to assume we can assess or not assess those in advance. Even within physics, a discipline that's intrinsic to our understanding of the universe and to the existence of <em>every</em> item of modern technology, some categories of study are scorned for their assumed inability to yield dividend.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/erudition-food.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3789 alignleft" alt="erudition-food" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/erudition-food.jpg" width="208" height="304" /></a>For this reason, William Shockley, co-inventor of the transistor, dedicated part of his 1956 Nobel Prize speech to say: "I would like to express some viewpoints about words often used to classify types of research in physics; for example, pure, practical, etc. It seems to me that all too frequently some of these words are used in a derogatory sense, on the one hand to belittle the practical objectives of producing something useful and, on the other hand, to brush off the possible long-range value of explorations into new areas where a useful outcome cannot be foreseen... It will take both types to confer the greatest benefit on mankind."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is oxymoronic that we should declare that good lives eschew the pursuit of the knowledge in favour of generic lives designed on principles of survival. Our survival has always depended on the development and scientific application of our cognitive advantage. I may be grossly oversimplifying anthropology on that point but I defy anybody to convincingly tell me so without having studied that field; one which often is included in lists of pursuits that “are fine but won’t help you get a job”. It was not so long ago after all that the pursuit of knowledge at all was limited to the wealthy with free time. Philosophy has never been the engagement of the masses. Yet by putting the tools of expansive thought processes and inductive reasoning at the disposal of the masses, we increase incomprehensibly our chances of producing success. Some after all can find the connections between <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/3">epic Renaissance literature and financial analysis</a>. Meanwhile, in his own anecdotal words, Steve Jobs' most important lessons came from calligraphy class.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Such is the contradiction of the vilification of the simple desire to understand. Not just understand things that an undergrad at the economics faculty of Chicago or Calgary has declared pleasing to the current whims of the invisible hand, but simply to understand. There is nothing noble in belittling the cerebral expansion of our collective possibilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which raises the point: who is going to pay for somebody to exist, let alone maintain a dignified lifestyle, who is merely producing information that cannot be rapidly commodified? From an economic perspective we all have an interest in doing so, which is precisely why that funding could, and should come from anywhere. I will not begrudge any economic system that delivers such. It could be the state, Engels (or another sponsor as it once usually was), or one’s own bootstraps equally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course the next logical thought is “Well wouldn’t we all love to sit around and study philosophy without working then!” Well, then study philosophy. Contribute to the field. The one condition is you have to tell me it isn’t work after you’re done. Not only that, but tell me it’s work that goes properly appreciated by most people — let alone the droning opinion of the drivelous mediocratic realm of profit-seeking information distribution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And that is the real problem isn’t it: we have mistakenly decided the problem is who is going to pay for people to study things we aren’t sure are going to be useful. We put the burden of investment and failure on individuals and yet when their research yields new information, perhaps in more indirect ways than we’d like to acknowledge, we all share the benefits. We all have the binding ties of literary and musical culture; the moral common ground of philosophers; and the common celebration of the success of the quantum model of physics. Meanwhile, we contemplate how a socially constructed governance structure founded on barter and trading can support the fulfillment of an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. We will not find an answer to how to monetise every field of study, but chastising unemployed graduates for an unfortunate and vulnerable predicament as the victims of their own demise could easily be an ironically prophetic diversion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With that then, I will conclude by proposing a beatitude be added to the canon of Humanity, only a slight variation on one previous: Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for knowledge, they will be satisfied. And because of them so will the rest of us. Or rather; Blessed are those who study something useless, thus we are masters of all trades.</p>
