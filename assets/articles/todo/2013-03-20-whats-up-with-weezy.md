<p>I like to be in the know, and I’ve got a whole slew of different news aggregators that help keep me there. Ever since getting an iPhone, it has become a point of personal pride with me. As news alerts zip to my homescreen, I smile lovingly at the device that has made it all possible. But after the events of this weekend, I’m starting to question how good any of my up-to-the-minute information really is.</p>
<p>It all started out as a Friday night like any other - I was browsing through Zite, my personal slice of the zeitgeist, on my shiny and perfect phone. Suddenly, an article from Jezebel stood out on my screen like a lollipop on Cut the Rope. Lil Wayne in Critical Condition, Rumored to be Receiving Last Rites. As I read on, I couldn’t help but think: what fresh hell is this?</p>
<p><em>We're told several people are at Wayne's bedside crying, and a number of rap artists and family members are on the way. Sources say the scene is violent as Wayne shakes uncontrollably.</em></p>
<p class="float"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Lil_Wayne.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5366" alt="Lil_Wayne" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Lil_Wayne.jpg" width="640" height="428" /></a></p>
<p>I quickly got a phone tree going, with the help of more apps. I thought I had scooped this story before my not-so-tech-savvy compatriots. I would be queen of the bar tonight. People would run up to me pleading for more information about that basketball-loving-sizzurp-guzzling scamp. “What’s the word on Weezy?” The cries would ring out. The hook looped in my head: It’s time to give me mine/ I’m so far ahead man/ What they talkin’ about. It was time; time to give me mine.</p>
<p>My hopes were quickly dashed. Within 90 seconds, a dear friend called me, “Your story is bunk; Weezy’s fine.” What?! This just couldn’t be; Jezebel wouldn’t lie to me. They stand for women’s rights and shit. <em>Without airbrushing</em> are their watchwords. They don’t buy into the hype. The man cannot stop convulsing for god’s sake! Plus, Jezebel ran this right on top of the news that Ryan Seacrest and Julianne Hough broke up; it had to be legit.</p>
<p>Well friends, a quick googling turned out plenty of conflicting stories and opinions re: The Carter. It turns out Jezebel was just one of many jumping on the retweet and #prayforweezy bandwagon. According to Time Entertainment, he’s recovering. But even Time could only substantiate their claim based on “his camp and his Twitter account,” so who the hell knows.</p>
<p>Let this be a cautionary tale to you who absorb all the flotsam on the web like hungry little sponges. You can trust no one! Except your lovely friends here at Distilled, of course. We would never lie to you. And Weezy, best of luck to ya.</p>
<p>Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. is set to release his 10th studio album on March 26th.</p>
