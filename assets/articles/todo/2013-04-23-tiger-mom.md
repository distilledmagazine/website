<p>Since the publishing of Amy Chau’s controversial article in the Wall Street Journal entitled <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754.html" target="_blank">“Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior”</a> and the subsequent book Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother – more of a memoir than a parenting guide – much has been made of the supposed distinction between so-called Asian and European styles of parenting. The article emphasized a strict code of discipline with children including such gems as forbidding a child from attending a play date, being in a school play, playing any instrument other than violin or piano, and getting any grade less than an A at school. Parents were encouraged to be tough on their kids and drive them to succeed primarily in school but also for reasons beyond me, in classical music. The article suggested that Western parents were too concerned with their children’s self-esteem to give them the tough love they needed to succeed when compared to tiger moms.</p>

<p>The article instantly faced a barrage of criticism, primarily focused on tiger parenting methods being supposedly cruel, morally questionable or psychologically damaging to children who could not possibly enjoy their childhood under a regime of such strict parenting. I wish to pursue an altogether avenue of criticism of the tiger mom method however, namely that while it can make children successful in adulthood, it will not make them the most successful of the lot. In other words, tiger parenting may end up creating various well salaried middle management types but it is unlikely to create world beating CEOs or heads of government, and even less likely to produce renowned artists, writers or actors.</p>
<p>By putting studying and hard work over socialization with one’s peers and general interaction with others, the tiger mom method risks depriving kids the social tools vital for adulthood in an era when it is said most business deals get done on the golf course and not in the boardroom. This is as true in Asia as it is in America or Europe where business meetings in karaoke clubs are not at all uncommon. The world’s top managers, politicians and lawyers may be intelligent well educated people but they are also most likely charming smooth talkers who know how to wheel and deal when necessary. In a successful career, understanding people is often just as if not more important than understanding complex equations.</p>
<p>Just like math or piano, these skills require lots of practice meaning that those play dates and school plays the tiger mom is supposed to forbid may actually be a lot more useful than first thought. Even in applying for most entry-level positions, candidates nowadays are told to smile, joke and generally make themselves out to be an enjoyable person to do business with, rather than simply emphasize their academic credentials. And while dealing with clients in a business relationship may not involve as many martinis and witty double-entendres as portrayed on television shows such as Mad Men, it is still necessary to know how to be a good host whom people will enjoy socializing with.</p>
<p>But it is not only potential top executives and political leaders who may be missed in a world full of strict tiger mom style parenting. There would also be little room for the development of top novelists, athletes, actors, poets and painters who may have not done well in their studies but certainly excelled in their craft. Indeed, the only form of art that tiger parenting seems to encourage is classical music – played exclusively on violin and piano – and while too much Chopin may not be a bad thing, sometimes we all need a little Rock &amp; Roll.</p>
