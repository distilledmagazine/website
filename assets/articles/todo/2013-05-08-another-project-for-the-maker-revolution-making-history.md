  to create tools that engage our history as well.

<p><em>Jonathan Marino is the Direc­tor of Con­tent and Strat­egy at Map­Story.</em></p>

<p>“"We are all Makers,” Chris Anderson writes in his latest book, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368119307&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=makers"><em>Makers: The New Industrial Revolution</em></a>. “We are born makers…just watch a child’s fascination with drawing, blocks, Legos or crafts...These projects represent the ideas, dreams and passions of millions of people.”</p>
<p>True that. And here’s one more project for the Maker Revolution to consider: history.</p>
<p>Having history is what makes us human. It’s our capacity for telling stories, debating each other’s interpretations of events, and allowing reflections about the past to shape future action that separates us from the beasts.</p>
<p>And it turns out having a sense of history actually helps us perform better in the present. Writing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/fashion/the-family-stories-that-bind-us-this-life.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">in the New York Times recentl</a>y, Bruce Feiler cites work by psychologists Marshall Duke and Robyn Fivush showing that children with strong understandings of their family history enjoy higher self-esteem and a stronger sense of control over their lives. Now companies and even the military are using historical narrative and 'sense-making' activities to improve group performance.</p>
<p>So, as we tinker with new technologies that are sure to change our physical world, we ought to put equal effort into, literally, making history.</p>
<p>Already we see a lot of DIY style history-making emerging. In-person storytelling is definitely en vogue, prompted by the successes of TED, Fail Faire, and Moth. With blogging and self-publishing anyone who makes the effort can write history and publish their narratives. Projects like StoryTree and HistoryPin now make it easy to bring photos, video and maps into our historical reflection.</p>
<p>And, increasingly, we are able to make history that shows how places in the world change over time -- a practice historian Richard White calls spatial history.</p>
<p><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mapstory.org">MapStory</a>, a project I work on, is one attempt to empower makers of spatial history. As a nonprofit, open educational resource, MapStory allows anyone to see and show all the events and changes that occur at a given time, place or topic, anywhere in the world. It is one of the first open source platforms in existence that allows for spatial-temporal data and narratives to be crowdsourced, peer reviewed, and shared.</p>
<p>Take for example <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/475">this MapStory</a> composed by Nitin Gadia and fellow residents of Ames, Iowa. Working with the Ames Historical Society, local government, and their own Maker Space, Nitin and friends compiled data on every road, building and parcel built in Ames since its incorporation in 1864 and loaded it into MapStory.org.</p>
<p>Nitin and company focused their MapStory on infrastructure – buildings, roads, parcels. But a future MapStoryteller of Ames might take a different tack, perhaps emphasizing the Native Americans who resided around Ames prior to and after 1864 when Oakes Ames and other white settlers laid claim, or maybe visualizing changes in the land itself as a result of development. The possibilities are infinite. And this is just one town!</p>
<p>There’s a lot to figure out with MapStory and projects like it. We’re only at the beginning. But we’re excited by the belief that the process of exercising our historical imagination can give us a sense of empowerment as individuals and kickstart the civic engagement and social innovation we know we need to build our collective future in these changing times.</p>
<p>All innovations, after all, are really at root just forms of editorial, always building upon, amending, or reacting against that which has gone before.</p>
<p>To write new prologues, we first have to read the past.</p>
