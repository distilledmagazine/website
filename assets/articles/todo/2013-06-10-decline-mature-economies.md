<p><em>In California this weekend, U.S. president Barack Obama had an informal two-day meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. The meeting was believed to determined to decide the relations between the two superpowers for the years to come. Yet somehow this vital meeting was overshadowed by a scandal that typified the interactions between the two nations even better. In the wake of the NSA surveillance scandal even the famous Chinese artist/dissident Ai Weiwei has taken a break from criticising his own government <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/nsa-surveillance-us-behaving-like-china" target="_blank">to take on the U.S. instead</a>; one more piece of evidence that Western civilisation has arrived in a period of decline. But has it really? In this edition of Distilled Extra, Maciek Hacaga zooms in on the field where the whole "Rise of the East"-narrative started in the first place: the economy.</em></p>
<p class="break">In recent years, it has become very popular to claim the decline of the mature economies, those of the West in particular. Certainly, as these economies lie at the centre of the current depression, we hear uncountable voices proclaiming a period of irrevocable decline. When considered why, two main points are raised. Firstly, the West’s weakening position in international trade is interpreted as a failure to keep pace with emerging economies. Secondly, the failure to contain the crisis is used as a sign of the West's inability for leadership. Are these claims real though?</p>
<p class="break"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Victoria_Harbour_Hong_Kong.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5638 alignleft" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Victoria_Harbour_Hong_Kong-1024x681.jpg" width="300" height="198" /></a>Mature economies these days appear to be losing out in trade. As a consequence they are generating trade deficits due to expansion of emerging economies. At least, that is the often repeated argument. But empirical evidence allows us to question this. In fact, trade deficits have remained quite steady over the past decade, at around 1.5 percent of the GDP of the world’s mature economies. Strong regional divergences exist though. The Nordic countries remain strong exporters, while the U.S. and Great Britain are big importers. With more and more factories relocated to Asia in the last two decades, it’s blame this on a decline in the production of manufactured goods. But again the evidence tells a different story; the largest negative contributors to the trade balance of mature economies are the primary resources. Over the same period many mature economies have been running trade surpluses in knowledge-intensive manufacturing and services, reaching 1,3% in 2009.</p>
<p>This leads us to another myth: the dichotomy between "service economies" and "manufacturing powerhouses". Among mature economies the U.S. is supposed to be a prime example of the former, while Germany is generally considered the leader of the pack in the latter category. Many think that these so-called "service economies" are the world leaders in service trade, but this claim does not stand. The U.S. only exports 3,5% of its GDP worth in services, half as much as Germany. Nevertheless, despite the rising importance of services, manufacturing is still considered the engine of the economy and its strengthening is often seen as a top economic priority.</p>
<p class="break">There’s another aspect to global trade though, besides the issue of deficits. Trade is also believed to be responsible for the loss of manufacturing jobs in mature economies. This touches obviously more directly upon the life of many ordinary people than the abstract issue of trade deficits. Hence, as a relief or even a remedy, tougher trade enforcement was supported by a staggering <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AAM-poll-FINAL-B.pdf" target="_blank">62 percent of American voters</a>. What they don’t realise is that the share of manufacturing in total employment has been declining for decades, due to changes in the structure of demand and productivity growth. What we’re experiencing now is in fact merely the continuation of the structural shift from agriculture toward other sectors of economy, a process that started as long ago as the 18th century. As Western economies went on this route earlier than the others, it shouldn’t be a surprise that the majority of jobs in the mature economies have been created recently in services, not in manufacturing.</p>
<p>This brings us back to what Steve Jobs said in 2011 — that Apple manufacturing positions "aren't coming back". Things have changed apparently, because <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/u-s-factories-leaving-china" target="_blank">U.S. companies are leaving China</a> now. Some of them did decide to return home, like Caterpillar which is establishing nine new projects in the United States. In fact, the Spring 2012 Global Retail Manufacturers and Importers Survey clearly indicates that as much as <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/manufacturing-dilemma-leaving-china-going-where" target="_blank">50% of manufacturers and importers surveyed</a> are planning to move their facilities out of China. The most popular new destinations are not just the U.S., but also Vietnam, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Philippines. Some clothing brands are even considering <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/article-56963-textile-production-to-move-from-china-to-poland.html" target="_blank">moving to Central Europe textile production</a>.</p>
<p>This is part of broader change of China's position. The People’s Republic is <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/china-rebalancing-wont-doom-region" target="_blank">actively rebalancing its economy</a>, shifting away from reliance on the export of low-value-added manufactures, towards a domestic consumption-led model. This is creating opportunities for low-wage countries such as Vietnam or Indonesia, and it also gives the chance to countries like South Korea and Taiwan to export more high-tech devices to Asia’s biggest market. All this could prove to be the emergence of a new regional centre-periphery system with China as the hub.</p>
<p class="break"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Min-Zhu.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5640 alignright" alt="The Future of Chinese Enterprise: Min Zhu" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Min-Zhu-300x197.jpg" width="240" height="158" /></a>With global trade does in a better state than it’s made out to be, there's still the issue of worldwide economic cooperation. The surprising pace and geographical spread of the current crisis has led to claims that the we should prepare for the complete failure of global financial governance. The escalation of Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, the collapse of the WTO’s Doha Round on further trade liberalisation, and the breakdown of the macroeconomic policy consensus within the G20 are the most obvious examples. What hasn’t been stressed enough though, is that the international economic system has been surprisingly resilient compared to 1930s. Unlike the UK back then, the United Stated have retained their unchallenged hegemony due to dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency. Countries like China who hold capital surpluses, found that keeping large amounts of dollar-denominated assets has bound them with the U.S. in financial terms.</p>
<p>However, "rebalancing" remains the key word in financial matters. The appointment by the IMF of a Chinese deputy managing director (Min Zhu, see photo), and the rising quota sizes of the BRIC countries within that body show that global financial governance has become more inclusive. The transformation of the financial body of the G20 (the Financial Stability Forum to the Financial Stability Board) is clear sign of both: the rising inclusiveness of the global financial order and its increasing capacity to address structural threats. Nevertheless, with falling number of bilateral investment treaties the Western international economic order — within which most countries cooperate — retains its dominant position.</p>
<p class="break">So considering all this, the West's economic position doesn’t look as dark as a lot of people like to paint it. The shift from manufacturing to more prospective services has given mature economies a good position in the global economy. At the same time the geographical movements of manufacture from East Asia to the other parts of the world, suggest the rising regionalisation of global economic activities. China is fast becoming a regional hub itself, just like the mature economies of the West.</p>
