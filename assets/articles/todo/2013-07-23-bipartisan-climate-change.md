<p>Together, we Americans always find a better way. We have found a way to save our European brothers and sisters not <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/watch?v=uP_0DkpFOKs" target="_blank">once</a> but <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/watch?v=AnpTWKKWQ1o" target="_blank">twice</a> from their own mass destruction, then build them up to enjoy the fruits of our prosperity <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Marshall_plan" target="_blank">under the watchful eye of George Marshall</a>. We have tamed the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" target="_blank">greatest aggressor</a> that our homeland has ever known, whose infamous red dawn was repaid with a pacific partnership of growth, trade, and friendship.</p>
<p>We are a country of dreamers who came to find liberty, escaping the oppression and prejudice of an Old World gone wrong. With those dreams and fierce hard work have come riches and power — the ability of this country of outcasts and iconoclasts to determine the fate of the world militarily and economically. That power has not and should not come the suffering of others. We have proven time and again that we may both succeed and bring success to others simultaneously. Leaving behind a dubious past of servitude in the motherland and at our own hand, we have spent a century fighting for freedom and democracy. We want to share our fortunes with others to ensure the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence" target="_blank">rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness</a>.</p>

<p>We are now faced with a new challenge, that of a warming planet and a changing climate. This is a challenge that is as significant as it is universally accepted by climate scientists. Every destructive storm and historic drought makes it clearer that climate change is happening and it is getting worse. How bad will it be for us Americans? I do not know. We have inventive and resourceful people with enough financial backing to give any challenge a fighting chance. We are the most successful country that the world has ever known and will remain that way through a warming climate. Letting this problem fester may not present an insurmountable difficulty for a country that has faced worse and come out better.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we do not face this challenge alone. As waters rise on 150 million people in the floodplains of Bangladesh and the rains cease over East Africa, these people will not have the same resources we have to face the fight. The consequences of climate change and poverty are inextricably linked. Tens of millions of refugees will be forced from their homes because we are choosing to grow at the expense of the suffering of others. While Bangladesh and Ethiopia are not our wards, we fail to live up to the paragon of the Greatest Generation if we throw an insurmountable plague upon them so that our economy may grow a trifle more quickly.</p>
<p class="break">Climate change regulation does not need some green jobs alchemy. It needs an American population committed to living up to our predecessors’ example. We should not apologize for our success, nor should we bring others down for our gain. We should support cap and trade or support a carbon tax, systems designed to make climate regulation as efficient as possible.</p>
<p>Cap and trade sets a maximum level of pollution that will be allowed in a given year, then allows the market to determine where, how, and at what cost that pollution will be created. Far from an overbearing centralized system, it was devised to achieve pollution reduction in the cheapest way possible by allowing the market to determine where pollution will happen. There are no blanket provisions or regulators pounding at the door. Products that create pollution will be more expensive, there is no avoiding that sacrifice, but cap and trade assures that the expense is as little as possible. It is an economist’s solution to an environmental problem.</p>
<p>A carbon tax works much the same way, assigning a price to pollution and then allowing the market to determine an efficient output. These programs do not guarantee that we Americans will gain. They require sacrifice, but they guarantee that we will live up to our obligation to the American way at the least cost possible.</p>
<p class="break">I will not have millions of tired, poor, and huddled masses on my conscience for a marginally better economy. Will you?</p>
