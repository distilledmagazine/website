<p dir="ltr">Meritocracies are great. In a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Meritocracy" target="_blank">meritocracy</a>, a person isn't judged by the family they were born to, the color of their skin, their sex or sexual orientation, or how much money they have. They are judged by the quality of their work and ideas, and the content of their character. There is no nepotism or favoritism of any sort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">How do we implement a meritocracy? We set up institutions that are accessible on the basis of merit. Want to get into a good college? Do well on the tests everyone has to take to get in, and make good grades. Want to work at a high paying job? Work harder, faster, and smarter than everyone else. Want that promotion? Show that you are better than your peers, do better work, and become invaluable to your company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">What makes a meritocracy even more amazing is that we incentivize all of these activities. Work harder and study harder at school, and you’ll make better grades. Make better grades and you’ll be able to go to a great college. Go to a great college and you’ll be able to work a well-paying job. Make the effort to get those raises and promotions, and you’ll soon run the company and have the respect and admiration of your peers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">At every step of the way there are carrots and sticks to make you a better contributing member of society. These incentives and disincentives form a ladder. Once society places you on that lowest rung, it’s up to you to ascend to the top based entirely on your own talents, skills, and gumption. If you get stuck on a rung or fall off the ladder altogether, you have no one else to blame but yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alas, there is a dark side to incentive structures. Incentives maximize qualities that we can measure at the total expense of qualities we can’t. Not only does that mean we produce people who are trained to see the world as a video game, where the person who has the highest score wins, we also end up eliminating useful qualities we need in people that ensure a vibrant and fluid society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is an even more sinister consequence to the technocratic gamification of our lives. Once we've established the rules for climbing up the ladder, we can game the system to our advantage. Having risen to the upper echelons of the ladder, I now know what it takes to succeed at every step. Naturally, I want my friends, my family, and my children to also succeed, so I’ll share the secrets for how to get ahead with them. Since at every rung there is some measurable quantity to maximize, I can then encourage my brethren to maximize only what it takes to move on to the next step. Because I am successful, I also have the money and time to ensure that people I know get just the right training and help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Expectedly, this crowds out those who aren't encouraged to maximize these measurable quantities. "<em>Sorry!"</em> school child who reads for pleasure and not to ace the standardized vocabulary test. "<em>Tant pis!"</em> graduate student spending half her time studying some far-flung subfield of physics. "<em>Schade!"</em> corporate executive who failed to maximize shareholder profits this quarter. You’re fired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">When you fall off of the ladder, or get stuck at a lower rung, no one listens to you anymore . Your influence wanes, and the longer you stay off the ladder the harder it is to get back on. Over time, the ladder gets rolled up, each rung becoming more and more inaccessible to those who are not already on one of the higher rungs or close to someone who is. As Jim Croce once put it, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/watch?v=j5sO0HbB5WY">"I'll be careful while I'm climbing cuz it hurts alot to drop, when you're down nobody gives a damn anyway"</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This particular phenomenon was excellently described by Chris Hayes in his book <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/#review" target="_blank">Twilight of the Elites</a> as applied to the system of testing that once allowed all classes of New Yorkers to access some of the top public high schools in the city. Unfortunately, that system is now dominated by the progeny of the successful and rich graduates of these schools. Hayes relates this example to a concept known as “The Iron Law of Oligarchy”, first coined by the German sociologist <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Robert_Michels" target="_blank">Robert Michels</a> in 1911.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Michels adopts a slightly different framing than what I have just described. He argues that as organizations (and society) grow larger, they by necessity employ more and more people. Functions within growing organizations become ever more specialized, and a sprawling bureaucracy is born. That means that certain tasks will be delegated, and a centralized governing elite emerges to manage this distribution of tasks and power. This centralized authority becomes the local oligarchy, and will tend to seek out policies that ensure its own survival.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The parallel between Michels view of growth and that of a meritocratic system revolving around incentive structures is instructive. Meritocracy is a principled ideal about how mass society, consisting of many people and organizations, ought to be organized. Unfortunately, most people believe that the only way to achieve a meritocracy that is truly fair and just is through incentive structures, which many have shown veers toward corruption over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Given that we do want a society where a person’s merit, their talent and skill, can be best put to their own individual and societal use, how can we possibly achieve such a society without incentive structures? I don’t know the answer. We want some way for individuals to relate to each other that avoids the “rolling up the ladder” effect over time and also doesn’t diminish those qualities of humanity that are immeasurable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">To find a solution, we must consider what causes an incentive structure to malfunction. Human beings are clearly not robots, otherwise incentive structures would produce flawless amoral killing machines (the evil that <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Hannah_Arendt" target="_blank">Arendt</a> encounters in her book Eichmann in Jerusalem). As such, most humans have experienced feelings such as love, heartbreak, caring, respect and admiration, shame, a sense of belonging and community, and a desire for liberty and freedom. These feelings can all short-circuit, at least for a short time, any incentive or disincentive structure (take for example fast food workers who sneak food to the hungry even though they have everything to lose by violating corporate policy).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">These human feelings that allow for us to relate to each other apart from rational incentives, yet still allow us to achieve the goals we set the incentive structures up for in the first place, are consequences of becoming more in touch with our essential humanity and the humanity of others. I would group the development of this sense of humanity under the larger process of developing empathy. Perhaps we should consider what an empathic civilization looks like as opposed to the transactional one we currently inhabit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While I may not yet have a clear answer about what lies next, we should have an open global discussion about the next stage in the evolution of how we relate to each other. Otherwise we may be stuck perpetually frustrated about why our meritocracy makes us feel so inadequate.</p>
