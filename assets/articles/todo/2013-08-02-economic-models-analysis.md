<p dir="ltr">“What’s in a name? that which we call a rose</p>
<p dir="ltr">By any other name would smell as sweet”</p>
<p dir="ltr">[/quote]</p>
<p dir="ltr">Juliet, speaking to Romeo in one of Shakespeare’s most famous passages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, since <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Tulip_mania" target="_blank">Dutch Tulip Mania</a> subsided some 20 years after Shakespeare’s death, mainstream economics has not concerned itself much with flowers.  Economic models, by another name, would no longer be economic models.  They would be simple mathematical demonstrations of relationships between variables, beautiful in their own right, but having little relationship to the human world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">How things change when an influential scholar declares that these mathematical relationships describe human interactions and choices.  Suddenly, we have a theory of human behavior that is ready to be tested and implemented.  These relationships have enhanced our understanding of the world.  We have done economics.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Models are necessary.  In order to focus on the most important aspects of the analysis, any model must abstract away from all of the random clutter that makes it difficult to see in practice.  If there were no clutter, there would be no need for economic analysis at all; we could simply describe the world as we see it.  Models allow economists to focus on a specific relationship and describe the interaction of a set of considerations under certain assumptions.  It is a very enlightening process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The problem starts when economists attach names to their models.  Instead of simply describing a way of relating variables, these models suddenly describe “volatility,” “intertemporal dynamics,” or “risk aversion.”  With a simple name, a basic mathematical relationship suddenly is labeled a description of the world.  So long as it fits a general description of the concept, we are considered closer to understanding volatility, economics over time, or people’s psychological reaction to risky decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the concepts of volatility, decisions over time, and risk decisions are complicated.  If people were easy to understand, we could wrap up this whole psychology study and move on.  It has been <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/The_mis_behavior_of_markets.html?id=9w15j-Ka0vgC" target="_blank">shown</a>  that <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/The_Black_Swan_%28Taleb_book%29" target="_blank">volatility </a>and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Prospect_theory" target="_blank">risk</a> are significantly more complicated than the simple assumptions of the models allow.  In fact, it is easily demonstrable that these concepts are more complicated than this type of model could ever describe.  If the assumptions were more intricate, the mathematical conclusions would break down.  There would be no conclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is where it all returns to a name.  When confronted with unfortunate revelations that volatility cannot be captured in a measure so blatantly simple as variance, economists now have an answer.  “Do you have a better ‘model of volatility’?”  Because they call it a model of volatility and risk, suddenly, they get to claim to have a “model,” even if it demonstrably fails at its stated purpose.  The effect of this question is subtle, but it is important.  It shifts the burden of proof to the challenger.  If the challenger does not come up with an alternative, they keep the old, failed “model.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This idea is absurd.  When the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Hindenburg_disaster" target="_blank">Hindenburg</a> burst into a fireball over New Jersey, the designers could not insist that their model of transatlantic travel be continued until a suitable replacement could be found. Once your model bursts into flames in front of millions people, the positives of hydrogen being lighter than surface air tend to fade from memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Risk and volatility modeling have already had their Hindenburg moment.  The model exploded into a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%93081" target="_blank">global financial crisis</a> that continues to leave millions of average people unemployed or underemployed.  Nonetheless, the models go on.  Financial firms make a lot of money from the idea that they can value “risk” mathematically.  Moving from a state where they can value risk to a state where they cannot is unacceptable, even if every day leaves taxpayers at risk of another explosion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thus, their failure becomes your problem.  The burden is on you to come up with a better model of risk or volatility.  The answer cannot simply be unknown.  By naming it a risk model, it becomes a prima facie case to continue their long trip back to Frankfurt on the zeppelin with our money and our future.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“[H]e went to the politicians, and then to the poets, and then to the craftsmen, but always with the same result—he found that they knew nothing, or hardly anything more than himself; and that the little advantage which in some cases they possessed was more than counter-balanced by their conceit of knowledge.  He knew nothing, and knew that he knew nothing: they knew little or nothing, and imagined that they knew all things.”</p>
