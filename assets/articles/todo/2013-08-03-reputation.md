<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-46a53add-437a-2e58-7e4c-c31a19103aa4">All we have in this world is our reputation. If we didn’t have our reputations, we would have to get to know everyone we meet in order to interact with them in ways that require trust. If you tell me your friend Carl, the used cars salesman, is a great, trustworthy guy, I’d be much more likely to buy a car from him than Shady Sam’s dealership just down the street.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Our reputations go far beyond our immediate social circle. Professionals rely on cultivating a sterling reputation to attract new clients and bolster their influence. <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Patrick_Leigh_Fermor" target="_blank">Patrick Leigh Fermor</a>, an early 20th century traveler who walked from London to Istanbul, relied on a gradually building reputation and letters of support to ensure lodging and board from town to town across Eastern Europe. Lawyers as a profession have an abysmal reputation, yet we still use that one lawyer or law firm who is one of the good guys that’ll do a great job representing your side in court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Yet, for all the difficulty inherent in retaining a good reputation, it can all be dashed with one simple mistake. This phenomenon is easily seen on Wikipedia. Celebrities and politicians may spend years with a sterling professional and personal track record, but one flop or scandal is all it takes to merit an entire section in the biography (usually told in terms far more salacious than those used elsewhere in the article). Let us solemnly reflect on those poor wayward souls, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Anthony_weiner" target="_blank">Anthony Weiner</a> and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Hugh_Grant" target="_blank">Hugh Grant</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">For most of us, our reputation is how we continue to make and enrich our professional and personal relationships. That’s why we are so careful to not squander it, our reputations are all we have.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unless you are a public intellectual or pundit who speculates left and right like a mad fool. In a strange paradox, no one will notice if you’re wrong or if you’ve lied despite the fact that people are constantly watching what you say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, let’s say that you are a prominent nationally syndicated columnist whose name is something like <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/George_Will" target="_blank">George Will</a> or <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Thomas_Friedman" target="_blank">Thomas Friedman</a>. Not only do you appear in some of America’s most prominent newspapers, but also on many prestigious television news programs. Or let’s say you are a well-known academic whose name sounds like <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Ken_Rogoff" target="_blank">Ken Rogoff</a> or <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Niall_Ferguson" target="_blank">Niall Ferguson</a>. You write cover stories for prominent news magazines and often appear on the lectures and panels circuit due to people’s belief in your expertise and your prestigious perch at Harvard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you get something right, like an assessment of a political or economic situation or a prediction about the future, you will likely crow until the cow’s come home from your particular farmyard roost. If you get something wrong, you will likely never mention it again, and certainly never admit you were wrong. No one likes losers who are wrong anyways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If someone does, however, happen to discover that you were wrong in the past, you can then try to deny that you ever said that (an increasingly harder task thanks to the internet and digital recordings). Or you could attempt to convince them that you made the best judgment given the information available to you. Besides, how could you not have made the best judgment? You are a prestigious professor at MIT, a NY Times columnist, and a member of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors. <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Larry_Summers" target="_blank">Larry Summers</a> and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/David_Gergen" target="_blank">David Gergen</a> are some of your best friends. You clearly tried your best, and it’s in everybody’s best interest to just forget your horrifically wrong prediction or shoddy work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fortunately for you, the public has already forgotten. When a pundit is wrong, the burden of proof doesn’t fall on the pundit to prove he or she is right, but on the critic to show that the pundit is wrong. So actually, no one likes the loser who is constantly trying to poke holes in what that smart lad from Oxford or Cambridge said on that Economist magazine panel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oh wait! You really screwed up now. You plagiarized your latest <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Jonah_Lehrer" target="_blank">book</a>/TED Talk/<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fareed_Zakaria" target="_blank">CNN.com</a> column. It’s really obvious plagiarism too; I’ve arranged the paragraphs beside each other and you didn’t even try to rephrase it. There’s even this one part where you made something completely up. You could claim that you performed an interpretive dance of sorts around the “facts”, but that just isn’t cutting it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">You think your career is over, but hold on one second. You apologize and blame it on the intern, or some personal failing, or something that is perhaps your fault but not “really” your fault. Damn those tight deadlines and your inclination to overcommit. A few apologies later, some public flogging, and maybe after a book deal, you get your Rhodes scholar butt back onto the pages of the New Yorker and an MSNBC roundtable. Charlie Rose kept the seat warm for you while you were gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It seems that for most of us even the smallest failure can ruin our careers and personal lives in a way that is irrecoverable. That doesn’t seem to be true for some public intellectuals. They are secure from ever having to worry that several bad predictions, shoddy work, or even unethical practices could sink their reputation. They are part of a close tight-knit family of the brightest minds of our generation produced by our most elite institutions, and aren’t we just glad that they are looking out for us?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">I sure am, because as <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/George_Bernard_Shaw" target="_blank">George Bernard Shaw</a> once said “My reputation grows with every failure”.</p>
