  they need power in institutions, ideas, communities, & ideological vision.'

<p dir="ltr">Protests in China are few and far between. So when there are protests of any sort against the government, they <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/world/asia/rare-china-protest-against-uranium-plant-draws-hundreds.html" target="_blank">make headlines</a> around the world. This past Friday, hundreds of people took to the streets of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/world-asia-china-23298663" target="_blank">Jiangmen</a>, a city in China’s Guangdong province, to peacefully protest the building of China’s largest uranium processing plant. This protest in Jiangmen, not far from Hong Kong, was billed as a simple stroll intended to show discontent with the fact that the people of this city were only given ten days to submit comment on the processing plant project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Chinese government still exercises significant media censorship, removing posts from the popular <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Sina_Weibo" target="_blank">Sina Weibo</a> social network (like Twitter but more useful). Nevertheless word about the protest soon spread, attracting several young college graduates in their 20s and 30s as well as local factory workers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While many of the protesters were upset by the possibility of environmental contamination and the possibility that their city would become a nuclear whipping boy in the event of a war with the USA, the primary concern of most was that they weren’t given an adequate say in the building of such a massive project in their own backyard, nor were they provided nearly enough information on the risks such a plant would entail for those who live near it. According to the NYT article linked above, some have even proposed that the officials who decided to build the plant should be forced to live near it when it is built. To paraphrase the protesters: If you love it so much, why don’t you marry it?</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The protesters for their valiant effort first gained ten additional days, courtesy of the intervention of the mayor, to comment on the project. After those ten days were up, the nuclear plant project was cancelled, contrary to the expectations of most observers. Most protesters assumed their concerns would be chucked into the Pearl River delta like so many other acts of civil protest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite this success, protests in China and around the world have had a notoriously ineffective track record lately. Recent widespread <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/201383203740281694.html" target="_blank">protests in Turkey</a> have failed to achieve a change in how the ruling <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey)" target="_blank">AKP </a>and government behave, much less save <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013_protests_in_Turkey" target="_blank">Gezi Park</a> as was their original intent. The Indignados of Spain have barely moved the odometer on Spanish youth unemployment. Occupy Wall Street and its various offshoots burned bright and ignited a spark in the public dialogue before being quickly extinguished by a lack of oxygen in the debate about what to do about the banksters and the finance industry. And looking back 10 years ago, massive protests of millions around the world did nothing to influence the decision of many Western governments to go to war in Iraq.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are a few protests that did, however, work. The most prominent have been the protests in Egypt, in both <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Egyptian_Revolution_of_2011" target="_blank">2011</a> and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2012%E2%80%9313_Egyptian_protests" target="_blank">2013</a>. They have managed to unseat both presidents Mubarak and Morsi (the latter democratically elected).</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Why have these protests managed to achieve so much while others so little? Most protests lack alternative centers of power. People have been protesting around the world because they have lost confidence in their institutions and leaders to deliver a better future, and no longer believe that they are legitimately represented by decision-makers at all levels of society. So when they react in frustration by protesting existing regimes, they are expressing a fundamental dissatisfaction with feeling as if they have no future and no way to change that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Yet these protests often soon fizzle out. That is because there is nothing for people to latch on to: no alternative academic or intellectual institutions, no competing unified political organizations, no substitute social services and welfare organizations, etc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most importantly, these protest “movements” lack the fundamental attribute that make for truly successful political movements: an alternative compelling vision of the future with the ideas and people to back it up. And the people to back it up must have some existing power within the context of our current society.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In Egypt, this alternative source of power was the military. So when protesters went out into the streets back in 2011, many members of Mubarak’s government defected because they knew they could latch on to the military and still be safe. A similar dynamic against the ruling Muslim Brotherhood led coalition happened again over the last month.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Protests are certainly an expression of some sort of rhetorical and organizational power, but they need more than that to be successful. While movements don’t necessarily need armed coercive power (as in Egypt) to be successful, they do need the ballast of the power that resides within institutions, ideas, communities, and an ideological vision for the future.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Without these elements, even protests in free and open democratic institutions may wind up with the same fate as those in China.</p>
