<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-12a302cc-5c65-b34c-68b0-dc464640cb05">When I was 12, I was obsessed with <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/5194.Michael_Crichton" target="_blank">Michael Crichton</a> novels. I was a member of Generation Jurassic Park, which led me to check out every Crichton book at the Awtrey Middle School library. While most kids (and adults) were terrified by Crichton’s dinosaurs, gorillas, alien objects, and Japanese businessmen, I was most terrified by his airplanes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the novel <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/7667.Airframe" target="_blank">Airframe</a>, a quality assurance official for a fictional aircraft manufacturer struggles to determine what went wrong in a horrific plane crash. The novel opens with a harrowing description of a suspected aircraft failure as it happens, and then transitions into typical thriller novel material as our protagonist struggles to determine what really happened on that flight and whether her own employer was covering up a massive technical failure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">I had nightmares about being in a plane falling out of the sky for years. Then after I woke up and fell back asleep, I’d have nightmares about giant multinational corporations having no idea why their planes were falling out of the sky.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Which is why news about the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/boeing-787-dreamliner-a-timeline-of-the-latest-incidents" target="_blank">most recent fire aboard a Boeing 787 Dreamliner</a> means I won’t get much sleep tonight. The problem with these jets has been narrowed down to a problem with their <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/130118_boeing_787_battery_660.jpg" target="_blank">lithium-ion batteries</a>. Since these planes entered service in November 2011, there have been four incidents of battery failure, not including the most recent at Heathrow airport.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It has been about a year and a half since the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Boeing-787-Dreamliner-a-timeline-of-problems.html" target="_blank">Dreamliner was first unleashed</a> upon the world, yet Boeing is still having trouble pinpointing what exactly ails its aircrafts. While the problem may have been narrowed down to the battery, how it affects and propagates problems to other systems in the airplane are still not fully understood.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Further complicating the problem of diagnosing and treating the problem is the fact that Boeing has relied very heavily on diverse offshore suppliers in the name of cutting costs. This means that Boeing engineers find it much more difficult to inspect the design of individual components and investigate the conditions and practices of the factories that produce these parts than if they were produced in-house or in the USA. These parts manufacturers are also incentivized to paint a rosy picture of their product in order to compete in the market (and also benefit from how difficult it is within a complex system to pinpoint their part as the source of a problem).</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the 787 and its systems “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/business/boeing-787-catches-fire-at-heathrow.html?ref=787dreamliner" target="_blank">represent a significant advancement in technology</a>” for many people, I question whether the 787 is really more advanced than other airplanes. While I understand that many of the things we interact with in our lives are becoming increasingly complex, I find it very worrying when this complexity profoundly complicates our ability to assess and fix sources of catastrophic failure. What is worse is that some of this difficulty in diagnosing a problem comes from a desire to reduce costs through outsourcing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Our global economy is a lot like a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. There are many interlocking parts. These components are all interacting with each other in complex ways that we don’t fully understand. When something fails, the failure propagates in chaotic and unpredictable ways that can cause the whole system to blow up, like a plane falling out of the sky.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are many points of fragility within our global economy, between suppliers and consumers, supply chains and corporate overlords, economic institutions and policy makers. Much like Boeing, when something happens that causes the global economy to spiral out of control, we have a tough time pinpointing where the system first begin to fail.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alas, part of our inability to figure out how to correct our tailspin comes from the fact that our economy’s pilots aren’t even aware of our rapid plummet to the earth. Or if they are aware, they are content with letting the economy right itself, choosing to remain fundamentally incurious about what has failed and why. In their defense, the economy, like a plane, will right itself eventually – when it hits the ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many systems in our global society are on autopilot, and this has lulled our leaders into a false sense of complacency. Even though this autopilot has in some ways delivered a raw growth in output in the world economy, because it is driven by interlocking incentive structures, it has also failed to deliver other forms of growth and development. Income inequality has risen around the world. So has the frequency of institutional crises.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">How do we save ourselves from a possible fatal crash? We can start by acknowledging that increasing complexity bears a potentially terrible consequence in our near future. We can also start to acknowledge that <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/economic-models-analysis/" target="_blank">this complexity cannot be merely “modeled”</a> our way out of using Big Data. Finally we ought to start considering our policy, our leaders, and the structure and character of our political, economic, and academic institutions in light of the risk of catastrophic failure, and not purely in terms of how we can keep ourselves flying constantly level to the ground.</p>
