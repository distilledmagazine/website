<p dir="ltr">This week Spain and the United Kingdom fought out a small conflict about the tiny <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rock_of_Gibraltar" target="_blank">Rock of Gibraltar</a>. Central to the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/7f0ae226-ff4d-11e2-aa15-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2bpdrccfl" target="_blank">discussions</a> were the fishing rights around the British Overseas Territory: Spain claimed that recent harbor works hindered Spanish fishermen in their work. To back up its claims, Madrid increased border controls, elevating waiting times on the main roads up to seven hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dating back to the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Treaty_of_Utrecht" target="_blank">Peace of Utrecht of 1713</a>, the British possession of the peninsula precedes the days of rabid nationalism. It is therefore not this particular European invention that drives the conflict, but something else that did gain ground around this period. During the Eighteenth Century territorial sovereignty became a core principle of international politics. States gained exclusive rights to their territory: everyone had to respect their borders and no one could intervene in their internal affairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Great Britain is  one of the few countries left that still adopts a strict interpretation of this principle, as the Argentinians learned the hard way during the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Falklands_War" target="_blank">Falkland War</a>. The U.K. refuses to be part of the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Schengen_Area" target="_blank">Schengen Zone</a>, guarding its sovereignty against the economic expansion of the European Union, and holds on to numerous parts of its former empire. One of the reasons why Spain is able to increase pressure is precisely because there still are border controls between Spanish and U.K. territories.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In itself, the defense of British territorial sovereignty is of course a perfectly acceptable right of the London government. However, it takes a huge risk in doing so. Disputes as this usually start with discussions about  access to natural resources (fish in the case of Gibraltar, oil in the case of the Falklands, and numerous other examples for other countries), but the involvement of sovereignty transforms these minor issues into a general problem. This is because sovereignty easily becomes a strict principle; it stands or it falls, with no compromise possible once the states are reasoning according to its logic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The question thus is whether or not Spain and the United Kingdom really want, in this era of global communication and borderless societies, to play a dangerous game dating back three centuries. The risk for both is that discussions quickly escalate into a general discussion about the status of Gibraltar and the relations between both countries. Of course, there is no chance that the Spanish and British navies will have Falkland-type engagements, but in times of economic hardship both countries have better things to do than waste massive amounts of energy bickering about a 300 year-old decision.</p>
