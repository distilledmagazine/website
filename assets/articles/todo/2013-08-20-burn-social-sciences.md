<p dir="ltr">I have come to understand that the natural and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Social_science" target="_blank">social sciences</a> are dying slow deaths, infected by the tumor of hyper-specialization. That is why I was initially delighted to read co-director of the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/yale-institute-network-science" target="_blank">Yale Institute for Network Science</a> Nicholas Christakis’s  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/opinion/sunday/lets-shake-up-the-social-sciences.html?_r=0" target="_blank">article in the New York Times</a> explaining how the social sciences may be saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">His solution? Declare victory on some age-old questions and devote efforts to forging stronger links with the natural sciences through new interdisciplinary fields:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“So social scientists should devote a small palace guard to settled subjects and redeploy most of their forces to new fields like social neuroscience, behavioral economics, evolutionary psychology and social epigenetics, most of which, not coincidentally, lie at the intersection of the natural and social sciences.“</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While initially intrigued by this suggestion, I soon cringed. This should encourage interdisciplinarity. In practice, it really is just another form of hyper-specialization, except it further infects the study of complex fundamentally irrational social dynamics with even more simple reductionist rationalism. To some extent, Christakis foresees this problem as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“Still, such efforts are generally more like herds splitting up than like new species emerging. We have not yet changed the basic DNA of the social sciences. Failure to do so might even result in having the natural sciences co-opt topics rightly and beneficially in the purview of the social sciences.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Christakis is correct that having the natural sciences conquer the social sciences would be a calamity. Unfortunately, it seems the social sciences already suffer impending annexation by the natural sciences with nary a call to arms to defend the borders. Christakis sees this annexation and unification as potential salvation rather than a terrible loss of sovereignty:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“New social science departments could also help to better train students by engaging in new types of pedagogy. For example, in the natural sciences, even college freshmen do laboratory experiments. Why is this rare in the social sciences? When students learn about social phenomena, why don’t they go to the lab to examine them — how markets reach equilibrium, how people cooperate, how social ties are formed? Newly invented tools make this feasible. It is now possible to use the Internet to enlist thousands of people to participate in randomized experiments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“But to realize this promise, the social sciences, like the natural sciences, need to match their institutional structures to today’s intellectual challenges.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Experiments in a social science class? Not only does this seem methodologically unsound, but also impractical and completely removed from the critical engagement with real-world issues that our social sciences departments ought to be encouraging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Generating more interdisciplinary links is great for advancing our knowledge of human behavior and society, but forging connections with the harder sciences, such as neuroscience and psychology, serves to only vaguely illuminate the individual. Worse, this approach loads itself with so many assumptions about human behavior for the purposes of performing a controlled experiment that the results are often inapplicable in practical life. The joining of the social sciences and the natural sciences is like marrying two codependent sick people and expecting them to have a radiantly healthy child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The low-level conclusions of interdisciplinary fields, such as behavioral economics, cannot be aggregated to the macro level. As I discussed in my article on a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/social-dynamics-theory/" target="_blank">general theory of social dynamics</a>, these results are like making increasingly baroque minor changes to Newtonian mechanics in order to answer questions both at the microscopic quantum scale and at the galactic magnitudes of general relativity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">We’ve reached a point of stagnation in many fields of the social and natural sciences where making brief sojourns into the wilderness that lies at the edge of our understanding is not enough. What we need to do, to borrow an analogy from <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lee-Smolin" target="_blank">physicist Lee Smolin</a> (author of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/The_Trouble_with_Physics" target="_blank"><em>The Trouble with Physics</em></a>), is to climb off our own mountains of knowledge and cross the many harrowing valleys to climb new mountains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Only then will we be able to adequately deal with the many large-scale problems, such as climate change and interconnected economic instability, that threaten our nascent global society. As a joyous side-effect, we may also rediscover the art that pervades the world of science and mathematics (<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/math-lament/" target="_blank">as discussed last week by Daniel Baker</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">That is why the social sciences, committed to studying and devising practical responses to the great macro and micro problems of the human and societal condition, ought to veer away from ever-more convoluted <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Neoplatonism" target="_blank">Neoplatonic</a> model-building and head toward the great wilderness plumbed by the humanities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Art, philosophy, literature, nonlinear dynamics, and other fields devoted to coping with “unknown unknowns” seem far more apt for interdisciplinarity with the social sciences than the natural sciences. Let’s burn down the social sciences and rebuild them anew!</p>
