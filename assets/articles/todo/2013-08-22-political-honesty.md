<p dir="ltr">Glenn Thrush is the White House reporter for <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Politico" target="_blank">Politico</a>, a popular daily paper in Washington, DC. Politico is different from other papers in that it focuses on the “inside baseball” of Washington society and politics. That means developing close relationships with legislators on Capitol Hill and administration officials at the White House, generating lots of exclusive scoops from top officials, and forwarding lots of gossip about the comings and goings of Washington’s political social scene. Its singular focus on the minutiae and the ephemera of politics has catapulted Politico into a place of ludicrous prominence in only a few short years. From my time in DC, I found that most politicians’ offices on the Hill had only two newspapers:  a copy of Politico alongside a copy of the venerable Washington Post on the reception desk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Politico traffics in image and perception. How is this politician viewed in the media? How is he or she perceived by colleagues? Who throws the best parties on C Street? Why is John Boehner mad at Barack Obama? Who snubbed whom at Senator Schumer’s Christmas party? And the most important question of all: who is “winning” the day?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">That is why I was hardly surprised when yesterday <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/glenn-thrush-lies-gets-caught-promises-more?utm_medium=sfy.co-twitter&amp;utm_content=storify-pingback&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;awesm=sfy.co_jQ6I" target="_blank">Glenn Thrush got into a tiff with Media Matters for America’s Jamison Foser</a> over Twitter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thrush praises <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/role-public-advocate" target="_blank">New York City Public Advocate</a> and candidate for Mayor, Bill de Blasio, for owning up to being a fan of the Red Sox, rather than faking his love for the Yankees like that carpetbagger Hillary Clinton (who had a successful run for Senator of New York immediately following her tenure as First Lady). Foser points out that doubting Clinton’s attachment to the Yankees has been a trope among her opponents for years and that it has been debunked by citing public statements made by Clinton long before she ran for Senate (Clinton, who grew up in Illinois, has been a Chicago Cubs fan but also needed an American League team to support).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, the conversation with Thrush devolves from there into bizarre accusations of whether Foser is getting paid to call Thrush out and to a refusal to acknowledge that someone can be a fan of a National League team and an American League team at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alas, facts don’t matter for most pundits in the realm of politics. If Hillary Clinton is perceived as a carpetbagger, then everything she does or says must be confirmation of this public perception. If facts show that this perception is wrong, then either the facts are wrong or it is the politician’s fault for behaving in such a way as to make us believe things that are untrue. Political honesty is of no consequence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The best example of pinning the blame on the politician is former Vice President Al Gore. When he ran for President in 2000, he was widely noted for having said that he “invented” the Internet. <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/internet.asp" target="_blank">What he really said</a> in an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer was that he helped with legislation that ultimately led to the creation of the Internet. Nonetheless, once the misinterpretation caught fire, it became impossible to extinguish. When commentators and even the Gore campaign tried repeatedly to correct this error, the pundits would concede that their interpretation wasn’t entirely charitable to what Gore actually said. Yet, they would then follow up by saying that Al Gore should not have been the type of person whom one could believe would say something like that. In other words, stop being the type of person who seems like a liar (even though we put the lies in your mouth).</p>

<p dir="ltr">These zombie lies have become rampant in our discourse, not only when talking about politicians but also about policy issues. Austerity, for example, has been a panacea for all the ills of Washington (and London) for years now, despite clear evidence and reasoning to the contrary. There are several stories like this: about how we must appease so-called job creators as our top priority, how Obama has been “mean” to business owners, how illegal immigration from Mexico is ramping up exponentially every year, how the financial crisis was caused by a few bad apples in big banks, how young people are unemployed because they’re lazy moochers, how the poor have it too good with their refrigerators and cell-phones, how climate change is bunk because it was really cold today, how every Democrat wants to take away your guns. Political honesty is absent. These are stories that seem impervious to facts. What matters most is that they seem true and that they confirm what many, especially in Washington’s ruling class, already believe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If we are to stand on the side of facts and reality, we must acknowledge that the human mind is a story-telling, story-consuming machine. And for good reason! If we were constantly interfacing with facts and data, we would become overwhelmed. We would have no way of interpreting the world around us fast enough to make any decision. A constant, unwavering adherence to facts and rational logic would greatly diminish our humanity by submerging our emotions, passion, and rhetoric. We would become unable to relate and connect with people, to empathize with others without stories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">That doesn’t mean that facts aren’t important. Facts allow us to enter negotiations with the rest of the world around us. If we deny facts for too long, reality usually has a way of punishing us. People, however, are not dispassioned elements of Platonic truth, but rather creatures that thirst for narratives that allow them a sense of identity, community, and peaceful resolve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">We should seek to offer compelling alternate narratives that raise each other’s humanity above the level currently offered by our discourse, while also seeking to solve the real fact-based problems plaguing our society. That means we must embrace the human tools of rhetoric and storytelling along with the sublime flaws of human character, even if they sometimes stray from the facts, rather than seeking to make people always rationally enlightened.</p>
