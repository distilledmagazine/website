<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We need investors. Not ‘we’ as in any particular group of which I’m a member (although Distilled always has a spot at the negotiation table for you), but rather we as in the general populations of capitalist countries. More specifically, we need more investors. Ideally, everybody.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">For understandable reasons, finance was demonised in popular culture over the last half-decade and even beyond that. Additionally, there are serious problems with the way the finance industry is constructed and presented to seem exclusionary to those who do not have large amounts of excess capital. On the whole though, investing is not beyond the reach of most citizens and at the very least, understanding it should be seen more through the lens of democracy than of personal wealth. Beyond that, the barriers to entry are surprisingly low and the more important barriers have to do with knowledge rather than capital acquisition.</p>

Especially in men’s magazines, and other wares aimed at a similar audience, you will find a mixed spattering of encouragement to sort out your personal finances, to learn the ins and outs of the stock market, and of course a few stock picks. The latter has another seperate monster of an industry built up around it that hasn’t been without <a href="http://bizfinance.about.com/od/businessethics/p/StewartCramer.htm" target="_blank">it’s own scandals</a>. All of these sources are playing to your desire to increase your income by putting your income to work. Even if you have not gone in search of procedural knowledge for investing, they take advantage of the reality that most people are aware of: that idle money does not generally make money faster than inflation erodes its value. Your interests in investing go beyond your wallet though, and have a good deal to do with making a better society within which to live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Financial literacy is necessary not just to see opportunities to make money, but to see the world in terms of how money builds it. It is not hard, and begins with the fact that public companies are just that - publicly accessible. In addition to having an incentive to learn about the corporate world, investing - or acting like you do (if you cannot afford it) - makes you a participant in a side of the world that might otherwise seem enigmatic and nefarious (which to non-investors it might well be). Furthermore there needs to be more actors that are helping you get there without the exhaustion of buzzwords and “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory" target="_blank">type-A” personality</a> pseudo-psycho analysis that comes along with most print discussion of finance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The reason for this is that capital markets are a fundamental part of our economies, and they are fundamentally democratic. Unfortunately there is far less participation in them than any other democratic system. Putting aside the idea of one-dollar-one-vote, the number of people exerting influence in finance is minuscule and institutionally problematic. As <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Price_of_Inequality.html?id=0peLMgEACAAJ" target="_blank">Joseph Stiglitz points out</a>, only 10 percent of capital gains (profits from investment sales) are made by the bottom 90 percent of the population, and for households earning less than 100 000 USD, they make up only 1.4 percent of their income.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The problem is that whatever anybody does with their money is an investment. When you put your money in a bank account, you are just investing in that bank at a low interest rate with a government guarantee on the deposit. That means it is safe - but still an investment. It is also not an investment that gives you an active voice or encourages you to learn anything about the next steps your money is taking in the giant game of capitalist democracy. In comparative terms, just having a bank account is equivalent to living under a rock for a year and then flipping a coin at the ballot-box. It is the easiest way out and significantly underestimates your potential agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/5999874448_89cf519a5a_n.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7917" alt="Financial Markets, Finance Industry, Investors, Investment Opportunities, Free Market, Market Economics, The Price of Inequality, Stocks, Bonds, Trading, Investment Capital, Entrepreneurs, The World Needs You, Marxist Utopia," src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/5999874448_89cf519a5a_n.jpg" width="228" height="320" /></a> Just like learning about politics and getting outside of that media whirlwind, it is not impossible to learn relatively quickly how to invest. This despite the abhorrent fact that financial literacy is scarcely taught outside of a prep or private school environment. The language of the sector is not as inaccessible as the news would have you believe. You can also practise <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/" target="_blank">investing for free</a> and learn the ins and outs at the same time. Doing so quickly reveals a few sobering facts for those looking to turn a quick buck. For example: it is not hard to pick a stock that will go up, but since you pay for each transaction, it is really hard to make money with small amounts of money. This may well be why many feel it is not worth their time to learn something they do not have the funds to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">At the same time though, Investing now is easier than it has ever been. The days of mutual funds are basically over for one which makes investing immediately less of an “old boys club”. Because of <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/podcasts/etf-report/" target="_blank">Exchange Traded Funds</a> (ETFs), you can ‘invest’ in indexes, countries, industries, regions, and even bet on the market going down - without actually knowing the mechanics of short-selling or trusting the hands of a fund manager (most old-style funds do not give encouraging returns anyways). An exchange traded fund in a few words is a single stock, that aggregates the money of those buying it, and then puts that money into a (usually) transparent basket of real companies mathematically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Investing to make money may well be a foolhardy venture, especially if you do not have adept knowledge of current affairs. Over time though with these tools you can observe some of the ‘rules’ that you will hear spouted by financial talking heads. Try taking fake stock in GLD or NUGT (gold ETFs) before a major conflict. If that conflict happens, it will probably go up. Then again, maybe it has already been speculated up and will actually correct down - especially if that conflict is underwhelming. In a way, it is just another method of commenting on and trying to control the world like we do in elections, and probably not at any less important of a scale when you put into perspective the mechanics of how votes only matter in aggregate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Investing money is not gambling, and our economy and society needs the finance industry. Marxist utopian ideas aside, markets are a pretty fantastic invention. It makes an interesting world where people are supposed to be reduced to rational actors and do anything but act rationally. At the same time, it also means that banks are not the only way to raise funds for research and making things happen within the context of an organisation. Markets are also blind to anything except currency. While it does mean the rich can use them to stay rich, it also means they are not fundamentally discriminatory against anybody. This is not an endorsement of trying to make money, but rather one of trying to understand the systems that affect every aspect of your life. Do not just go and put money into a market, but do yourself and our capitalist democracies a favour and learn how doing so actually is a bold statement about the world you live in and the one you want to live in.</p>
