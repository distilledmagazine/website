<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Thomas Jefferson, perhaps the greatest of America’s founding “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" target="_blank">enlightened</a>” architects, was passionate man prone to love and heartbreak. As a young man, he spent time in Paris, during which he courted a married woman by the name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Cosway" target="_blank">Maria Cosway</a>. He fell in love despite knowing that his tenderness may never be requited. To assuage his pain, he penned a letter to Cosway wherein he personifies him and his love as the mind and the heart:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[quote align="center" color="#999999"]</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">When nature assigned us [the heart and the mind] the same habitation, she gave us over it a divided empire. To you she allotted the field of science; to me that of morals. When the circle is to be squared, or the orbit of a comet to be traced; when the arch of greatest strength, or the solid of least resistance is to be investigated, take up the problem; it is yours; nature has given me no cognizance of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In like manner, in denying to you the feelings of sympathy, of benevolence, of gratitude, of justice, of love, of friendship, she has excluded you from their control. To these she has adapted the mechanism of the heart. Morals were too essential to the happiness of man to be risked on the incertain combinations of the head. She laid their foundation therefore in sentiment, not in science. [/quote]</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I am certain you have felt such a pain as vividly as Jefferson and I have. For some time, I have struggled with giving expression to the struggle between mind and heart. Jefferson’s word gave me both perspective and succor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Yet, I have also struggled with determining what to do about the two forces that threaten to rent you, me, and everyone else in twain. Actions need to be taken. Consequences must be borne. Decisions must be made. I discovered through pain and trauma that the only way to survive the human condition is by diving into that vast ocean of human experience, emerging at the other side a changed person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/447970785_5dfe481594.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7934" alt="Thomas Jefferson, Love, Empathy, Social Dynamics, Theory of Social Dynamics, Religion, Society, Ocean, Ocean of Emotion, Currents, Metaphor, Civilization, Society, The Human Condition, Fernand Braudel, Longue Duree, History, " src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/447970785_5dfe481594-300x211.jpg" width="300" height="211" /></a>Indeed the metaphor of an ocean of human experience is a useful one. The ocean is ineffably large yet immediately approachable, unchanging yet constantly changing, consisting of layers with different ecosystems, inhabitants, and climates. One cannot change an ocean but one can be changed by it. One can foolishly resist its currents or ride them to their destination. One can attempt to control the ocean or more productively harness its immense power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The emotional and intellectual components of the human condition are united by this metaphor. That to which we apply our intellect, as described by Jefferson, are events and material systems that can be controlled and changed, much like the sea’s turbulent upper layer of surf. Yet, underneath that layer of what can be changed are the uncontrollable, unchanging tides and undercurrents. These correspond to the unpredictable, indescribably complex stages of the human condition against which our emotions and relationships perform a delicate dance, “a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more.” This is the realm of the heart, where empathy and love are better guides than compasses and slide rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Such insight has not been limited to individuals, but has rather been the inheritance of several world philosophies and religions, ranging from Zen Buddhism to Stoicism, from Christianity to Islam. Alas, while you may be aware of the prescription these philosophies and religions may write for individual human happiness and fulfillment, you may not realize that there exists a broader tradition of understanding, acting, and living with the weight of social dynamics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Civilization, that “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_heritage_of_mankind" target="_blank">the common heritage of humanity</a>” as described by historian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernand_Braudel" target="_blank">Fernand Braudel</a>, is that magnificent project of elevating our <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/social-dynamics-theory/" target="_blank">social dynamics</a> with which we are all hopelessly enmeshed. Indeed, our current quandary is described by Braudel as the great problem for tomorrow, as for today: “to create a mass civilization of high quality.” For all the vastness that separates my heart from yours, the whole of our relationship against those of others is what forms the oceanic dynamics of civilization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Braudel, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annales_School" target="_blank">other historians</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longue_dur%C3%A9e" target="_blank">Longue Durée</a> school of thought, goes to great lengths to more vividly analogize the course of civilization to complex natural phenomena. As Braudel describes it, there are the three planes of the history of civilizations that we may consider: the plane of current events, the plane of historical episodes, and the plane of vast civilizational phenomena.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">These are like the layers of the ocean. The plane of current events is like the ocean surf, fleeting and ever-changing. The blurbs and sound bites that interest the 24/7 news cycle are like flecks of water tossed violently into the air before disappearing into vapor. Pundits live to surf these waves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The plane of historical episodes is like the tides or mid-level currents. These events operate on a far longer time scale, but are ultimately reliable and predictable. We can tell where the current will take us or when the tide will wash away our castles in the sand. This plane is the one into which economists, political scientists, and other academics sink their rudders in an attempt to ride their boat to new lands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The plane of civilizational phenomena is the deep currents and streams, the plane in which massive continent-sized bodies of warm water are moved from one side of the ocean to another. This foundational slice of the ocean moves below it so slowly, so imperceptibly, that we may be led to believe it does not exist. But when it interacts with another deep ocean current, or when it changes, the “center cannot hold.” All is blown apart or, as was once sagely impressed upon me, “everything stays the same until everything changes.” Braudel aptly describes the manifestation of this plane of civilizational history:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/408714018_335c805a20.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7932" alt="Thomas Jefferson, Love, Empathy, Social Dynamics, Theory of Social Dynamics, Religion, Society, Ocean, Ocean of Emotion, Currents, Metaphor, Civilization, Society, The Human Condition, Fernand Braudel, Longue Duree, History, " src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/408714018_335c805a20.jpg" width="232" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">“The lives of countries and civilizations, and the psychological or spiritual attitudes of peoples, are not so seemingly immutable; yet generation succeeds generation without really radical change. Which by no means lessens – far from it – the importance of these deep, underlying forces that invade our lives and indeed shape the world.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The immense influence of the deep undercurrents of thought, the holistic result of the complexity of humanity, is perhaps the most important of all the oceanic planes to us in our current state. Since the Second Industrial Revolution, we have focused almost exclusively on the middle plane, that which is predictable and able to be known by science. Alas, we have barely paid lip service to the individual humanity that pervades the top-most layer of surf, and have completely ignored the foundational plane that underlies it all (save for geologists and cosmologists).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, the rather poor way we interact with each other, as individuals, community, nations, and a global society seems to be a symptom of a cancerous malady that resonates below our usual layers of analysis. As a result, we are unable to understand and act on collective action problems, such as climate change, global financial collapse, and war. Our impotence stems from submerging our quintessential humanity below layers of rational scientism and charlatanism.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Braudel describes the role of passion and the human impulse that resides outside of incentive structures in how we react to events:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">“A society’s reactions to the events of the day, to the pressure upon it, to the decisions it must face, are less a matter of logic or even self-interest than the response to an unexpressed and often inexpressible compulsion arising from the collective unconscious…. Here religion is the strongest feature of civilizations, at the heart of both their present and their past.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Braudel clearly implies that religion, in a spiritually ineluctable form, also lies at the heart of our future. As he states later in his book, “A civilization always involves a past, lived and still alive.” Religion, despite vocal claims to the contrary, is not dead. Nor shall it ever be. Rather it resides within the religions of old, or within modern religions such as economics and technocracy, no less articles of faith than the religions of old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Religion brings me back to where I started. We as a global society and human civilization are inevitably riding a journey of trauma and heartache. Other than small short-term descriptions, we cannot say what will happen, or even how or when it will happen on this journey. Most importantly, we will never be able to answer why. All we can embrace is that incredible tool that Jefferson found solace in, the heart. To deal with living in a world full of unpredictable complexity, risk, and humanity, we must fall back on our ability to love and empathize as one individual to another. Furthermore, we must find in our past and our present the ancient means of proliferating love and empathy at a communal level, until it has encompassed the whole of global society. Only then shall we be able “to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune” rather than vainly “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_be,_or_not_to_be" target="_blank">take arms against a sea of troubles</a>.”</p>
