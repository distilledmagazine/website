<p class="break"><strong>Through the Keyhole: Syrian Conflict Photography and the Perspective of the Voyeur</strong></p>
<p class="break"><em>Fighters eating enemy intestines in Syria, killer hands on display in London, and explosions in various shapes and forms: welcome to war on the internet! As a response, Thomas Burge discusses the modern visualization of war and its implications.</em></p>
<p class="break">Archived photography serves to capture a particular moment – or moments – in time. As an audience, we receive and interpret these moments after the fact; our impressions take on a necessarily retrospective hue, and are subjected to the vagaries of context and hindsight. Without exception, those who witness a documented perspective will find themselves susceptible to a preceding array of sympathies and understandings. At the point of contact, or in the act of witnessing, the various elements of preconception are either negated or confirmed; our assumptions will be challenged or corroborated, and sometimes both in equal measure. Recent Syrian conflict photography has yielded a throng of compelling imagery. A brief internet search will index hundreds of photographs and videos, with corresponding archives that collate and order the proliferation. Civilians and fighters have contributed a kaleidoscopic array of perspectives; most exemplify a conspicuous lack of the adornments that we associate with traditional, professional journalism, such as a stylised form of presentation, a signature tone, or the aesthetic trappings of a familiar editorial technique. In the midst of this plurality, we can nevertheless discern striking patterns. It is important to note the extent to which our reactions have tended to coalesce around particular forms of recorded spectacle; how are these interpretations anticipated and delineated by the photographer, which aspects of our own lives are being projected onto the images, and – perhaps most importantly – what does it really mean to bear witness?</p>

<p class="break">A prominent example of the Western archiving project is Watching Syria’s War, a high-profile <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/watching-syrias-war">New York Times initiative</a>. This resource presents selected pieces of video footage from the conflict in Syria, and purports to contextualise by embellishing each clip with a limited amount of background information. The project’s website is careful to highlight the difficulties of verification; videos are said to ‘claim’ authenticity, and each one is qualified with a case-specific assessment of ‘What We Know’ and ‘What We Don’t Know’ about the events that are presented. Dual qualification is thus used to achieve the remarkable feat of venerating and harnessing a negative; the very lack of contextual information is taken and cited as an indication of integrity, because it is openly declared and acknowledged. Most videos are accompanied with a link to a related YouTube source, but the initiative itself is not an open forum; footage is selected by the administrators of the project, with New York Times reporter Liam Stack credited as ‘Editor’. Thus understood, Watching Syria’s War becomes a specific interpretation of what should – and should not – constitute exigency and importance. By exercising editorial control, the administrators are able to generate and publicise a circumscribed body of evidence in the manner that they believe will best serve a stated raison d'être: ‘tracking the human toll of the conflict’. Conceived as such, we might expect the offerings of this resource to iterate and reflect the predilections of a particular Western readership. The audience cannot discern whether this reflection is consistent with an accurate depiction of the balance of experiences in Syria; to do so would require an open field of representation, without recourse to the expectations of a particular audience.</p>
<p class="break">A freer form of witness is commonly sought in YouTube. At first glance, the plethora of unsolicited submissions would appear to promise an open field; editorial discretion is largely absent, and all users are free to upload and display whatever they like. Closer inspection reveals a far more complex picture. Even if the selection of the source material itself is no longer a circumscribed exercise, we still face the question of whether the correlatives and signifiers of content are likely to engender new boundaries of qualification. YouTube’s archive of Syrian conflict material is stratified and delineated; all submissions are freely uploaded, but the attention garnered by certain examples has served to obscure and disqualify the value of others. Instead of simply being attributed to the formalised privileges of editorial discretion, these divisions should be explained with reference to the less visible ordering principles that govern the configuration of YouTube’s online collection. A YouTube search will rank the yielded evidence on popularity, and thus perpetuate the momentum of a well-received clip at the expense of others. ‘Related’ videos are then selected and recommended on a syntactic basis; the wording of searches and titles is paramount, as thematic similarities will not count unless they are specifically articulated in the names given to each piece of uploaded footage. This design lends itself to particular outcomes, with a pronounced and tangible effect online. Certain searches are facilitated, as their results are rendered accessible; others become more difficult and are effectively discouraged, which perpetuates the flat trajectory of less popular perspectives. It should be noted, however, that the ordering principles of this mechanism are not entirely sovereign. Popularity can be channelled or delineated, but it is precipitated by consumption. To understand this, we consider the relationship between content and consumer; between the agency of the photographer and the predilections of the audience.</p>
<p class="break">What is it that we really see of Syria? YouTube offers no system of classification beyond the titles that are provided by its users. As discussed, we perceive the subordination of thematic kinships to simple, arbitrary ‘keywords’; hence the confusing and erroneous understanding of ‘government tanks’ as synonymous with ‘opposition tanks’, or the troubling association of ‘Assad’s family’ and ‘Assad’s soldiers’. Rather predictably, this nominal approach is conducive to the investigations of those who seek to witness a single, tangible phenomenon, with little or no regard for wider context. The user who holds a particular fetish for military hardware is rewarded; he or she can observe an ‘AK-47’ in the hands of various actors across differing scenarios, and will fare better than the sociologist who looks for a contextual abstraction like ‘society’, ‘normality’, or ‘reconstruction’ (in whatever form). Singular objects and actions become commodities; they can easily be identified wherever they are, and will be transposed and witnessed across myriad circumstances by observers who show little interest in the environments local to each example. More abstract and intricate concepts can be filmed, but they do not lend themselves to online perusal; one would hesitate to ‘tag’ a video with ‘peace’, ‘progress’, ‘intimidation’, or ‘hope’, but ‘artillery’, ‘explosion’, and ‘rocket-propelled grenade launcher’ are available at every turn.</p>

<p class="break">To illustrate this dearth of nuanced comprehension, we have only to look at how the online archive is manipulated. The work of British blogger Eliot Higgins (A.K.A ‘<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/brown-moses.blogspot.co.uk">Brown Moses</a>’, is perhaps the most pertinent example of the singular, technocratic gaze. Higgins has tracked the presence of various weapons across Syria by looking at hundreds of videos, and is renowned for his keen eye and technical awareness. By paying close attention to the sources of this footage, Higgins has also developed an unusual ability to contextualise that which he sees; his efforts have furnished the evidence with geographical and political associations of telling significance, and his project is frequently cited and praised by international monitoring agencies. An assessment of the reactions commonly elicited by those same videos on YouTube, however, would suggest that most other users have failed to follow suit. Case-specific context is not usually a priority for the detached witness or commenter; accordingly, the specialist YouTube channels that compile selected pieces of footage – often with the aim of furthering a particular interpretation – are unlikely to provide much explanatory detail. <a href="www.youtube.com/user/warsyria/videos">Sitik Syria</a> is a conspicuously pro-government channel ‘dedicated to war and violence in Syria’. The marshalled evidence is treated in a typically generic fashion; video titles invariably include ‘war’ and ‘violence’, with dissidents simply referred to as ‘terrorists’. A sense of geographic or political context is rarely invoked; instead, users are invited to ‘like’ or ‘dislike’ the ‘army’ or the ‘rebels’ at the beginning of each video. This reductionist tendency is a recurring feature online, and is discernible throughout most of the Syrian channels on YouTube. <a href="www.youtube.com/user/SyriaTVOnline/">Syria TV Online</a> offers a preponderance of nondescript ‘sniper’- and ‘tank’-related material. It even provides users with the occasional ‘first-person view’ from an armoured vehicle, akin to a perspective more commonly experienced by players of military-themed computer games. It is perhaps no coincidence that Eliot Higgins has attributed the beginnings of his Syrian weapons project to formative expertise gleaned from Call of Duty; the average consumer of this game will happily detail the tangible specifications of a favourite virtual weapon, but would struggle to articulate any wider dimensions of the (fictional and largely ambiguous) conflicts that challenge intrepid players to survive and conquer from the safety of their living rooms.</p>
<p class="break">In witnessing these reductive perspectives, we are witnessing spectacle. Broadly speaking, YouTube’s video evidence seeks to engage the witness on one of three planes, whether retrospective, immediate, or prognostic; footage is concerned with the past, the present, or the future, and will sometimes combine two or all three of these elements at once. Aid agencies attest to the tribulations of the displaced, before considering the ramifications of the future. Fighters record the body count, and might hope to inspire others by recalling the outrages of the past. A much greater part of the video evidence, however, is reductionist, tangible, and immediate; it deliberately attempts to locate the viewer in the moment, even if the moment itself has since passed into recent history. Such footage is extremely popular. Its presence tends to obscure or discourage a wider view; however morbid, it possesses a visceral, kinetic quality, and is deemed exciting. To witness it is commonly understood as a rare insight; it is a privilege, and one that should be prized and commended. The problem with according something the status of privilege is that it then becomes desirable; we want these things to happen, and we seek them out wherever they are. In responding to the intimate spectre of Syrian conflict photography, web users have demonstrated a fascination with kinetic action; this is pursued and emphasised to the detriment of any holistic, more informative assessments of what has and what might occur. An audience that is accustomed to purely fictional representations of exotic and distant phenomena – visible violence, vivid explosions, the crackle of gunfire – will seize at any chance to safely witness a narrow but compelling account of the real thing. In the process, we diminish and objectify the lives (and deaths) that are seen; the audience seeks violence without context, without reason, and becomes complicit. We assume the role of the voyeur, and concern ourselves only with selfish preferences.</p>

<p class="break"><strong>People in the Shot: Interview with War Photographer Marleen Daniels</strong></p>
<p class="break"><em>As the media landscape shifted enormously during the past two decades, the ways in which violence and war are depicted have changed as well. With Thomas Burge criticizing the sensationalist approach of much of the amateur ‘reporters’ in Syria , Distilled decided to bring in a professional for comment. <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/www.marleendaniels.com">Marleen Daniel</a>s, war photographer during the turmoil in Lebanon of 1989, the first Iraq War, and the wars in former Yugoslavia agreed to speak to us.<br />
</em></p>
<p class="break">As a first element Distilled inquired about the notion of a ‘picture archive’, used by Burge to describe the current (random) collections of photos and videos on Syria. We indeed can receive pictures either as individual visualizations added to newspaper or magazine articles, or as collections of photographs centered on a certain topic. In the first case, the goal is generally to create a shock-effect, as the image needs to convey everything about the conflict at once. According to Marleen Daniels, this is something of which the photographer is well aware. In her opinion, every image retains the power to tell a lot. A prime example of this is the picture of a statue of Our Lady in a destroyed church in Beirut, which for her captured some central points about the conflict. One shot retains the capacity to clarify whether we are looking at a religious conflict, ethnic violence, a civil war...</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_5593" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/1989Beyrouth_01.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5593" alt="Beyrouth 1989, property of Marleen Daniels" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/1989Beyrouth_01-300x203.jpg" width="300" height="203" /></a> Beirut 1989, property of Marleen Daniels[/caption]</p>
<p class="break">But these really strong photographs are however rather rare in her opinion. The major difference with sets of photos then becomes that not every picture of the archive needs to be incredibly strong. This allows for the inclusion of images that are less pungent but tell the story in a clearer way. Although dependent on the topic chosen and the time the photographer spends in the conflict zone, the amount of nuance that can be brought to the story is significantly greater in this situation. For Daniels one specific sort of nuance that can be added is, if possible of course, information about the post-war situation. A significant story for her in this respect is that of the bridge of Mostar, a 427 year old Ottoman bridge that was destroyed during the Bosnia War but has been rebuild in 2004. In any case, from the photographers perspective the creation of an archive with a story is a lot easier than the creation of one powerful image.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_5595" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/1995Bosnia_2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5595" alt="Bosnia 1995, property of Marleen Daniels" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/1995Bosnia_2-300x207.jpg" width="300" height="207" /></a> Bosnia 1995, property of Marleen Daniels[/caption]</p>
<p class="break">As the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/was-2013-world-press-photo-year-fake">controversy surrounding the latest World Press Photo</a> has shown, images are often subject to criticism for not being completely ‘true’. However, every type of visualization immediately suffers from some subjectivity and pure reproduction is also impossible in war photography. Take again the case of the statue of Our Virgin Lady: Daniels acknowledges that as a reporter there immediately arises the question whether or not you want to portray the fighting as a religious war or not. Also, the context in which the image is received makes a huge difference and can distort the original intentions of the photographer. At the beginning of her career, Daniels was sometimes surprises by which photos were selected by the news agencies, although with hindsight she now understands why they might have done so. The context of the picture during its creation, publication and commemoration therefore all result in a very different reading of it, even by the image’s creator.</p>
<p class="break">Nevertheless, the level of distortion in professional media has somewhat declined. Whereas in previous decades it were indeed the editorial boards that chose the pictures, Daniels now states that current reporters have much more control over which picture is used for what article. This implies that there is a stronger debate between the news and the photo. The reporter in the field, who in Daniels’ experience is always mainly concerned with the images themselves, no longer merely follows the news created at home but retains a stronger say in how the war is depicted. So although this does not remove all subjectivity from war photography, the voice of people present in the war has become stronger compared to that of editorial boards who have no direct access to the conflict.</p>
<p class="break">Besides post-factum distortion, there is of course the risk of stage setting or outright censorship by the fighting parties, something which Daniels herself also encountered. In the latter case, a lot is determined by the actual use of force: going to Srebrenica at some point was an option, but she refused to go as she probably never would have left the town. Similarly, during the heydays of the Bosnian sniper war, a home for the elderly where Muslims, Serbs and Croats live together was simply inaccessible because of the danger. In these instances, the basic logic of violent force censured what could be seen at home.</p>
<p class="break">In the case of active staging of events, what is seen by the audience much more depends on the attitude of the photographer him- or herself. She recalls some moments when her agency let her know that a certain type of image (often following a picture owned by a rival company) would suit them very well. But as soon as things were actively being staged she always refused to take the shot as this would have set a very dangerous precedent, both for her own work and for the stage-setter. And this feeling of unease about scripted photos becomes something like a sixth sense for any good war photographer: when asked about the current media war fought out in Syria, Daniels clearly confirms that you can sense that a lot of the media output is being steered from above or below. In this respect, the creation of the International Criminal Court in the Hague and the better understanding of modern media have made the work of many reporters a lot more difficult: whereas in Bosnia soldiers carelessly killed people before the camera this behaviour has become less and less common, some recent examples excepted.</p>
<p class="break">Regarding the methodology and deontology of war photography she moreover stresses that reporters should remain as invisible as possible and shouldn’t place themselves in the middle of the action. Staying in the background whilst showing the emotions of the people is and remains for Daniels a core doctrine of her work. Added to this is the aspect of human dignity: although the composition of a picture is important for every photographer, the reason why Daniels wants to shoot ‘beautiful’ war pictures is because the people in them still deserve to be portrayed in a beautiful way. The raw reality of war does not need to not need to be glorified or covered, but the its victims are still entitled to the respect of a decent picture. To make a contrast, during her tours Daniels observed some photographers taking shots of prisoners sitting on the toilet.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_5596" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ROEMENIE-89_6.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5596" alt="Bucarest, Rumania 1989, property of Marleen Daniels" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ROEMENIE-89_6-300x203.jpg" width="300" height="203" /></a> Bucharest, Rumania 1989, property of Marleen Daniels[/caption]</p>
<p class="break">For her, much of the images on social media nevertheless have become much more voyeuristic, as editorial control has been removed. Professional photographers, when they do their job correctly of course, think more about what to shoot and whether or not to provide it to the news agencies. The key story for Daniels in this respect was that of a twelve year old kid whose yaw was shot away during the Balkan conflicts. At the time, she took the kid’s picture in order to give him the feeling that he was still worthy of a photo, that he was still a person like the others who she portrayed. The brute image will stay with her for the rest for her life however, and will consequentially never leave her own archive. Because of this sheer impact of such unsettling images, she doesn’t understand why people look at them or why they would deliberately seek them out. The stream of unedited material therefore possess a danger in her opinion, as people might forget that war is more than the raw shocks currently placed on the internet.</p>
<p class="break">She at this point fully agrees with Burge’s remarks: when looking at the the youtube videos and the Brown Moses blog (something she would normally never do, she declared) Daniels confirms that these descriptions and depictions tell little about the complexities of violence. But regarding the argument that a lot of the visual material about Syria fails to touch upon how the conflict impacts on the wider society, she nevertheless feels that this remained much more possible in her own work. She believes that she could show the sorrow of the children and the uncertainty of the parents, and therefore always made a central point of this. Showing the simple human life, the basic things like how to find heating, water or food where for her key aspects of any war. One of the stories she vividly recalls is that of a lady who needed a full day of preparations just to be able to wash her hair. And returning to the first point of discussion, telling such tales indeed requires indeed the creation of a photographic ‘archive’ as one image is unable to capture the day to day survival of people.</p>
<p class="break">As a final word, Daniels briefly explained to us why she stopped working as a war photographer some time after Yugoslavia. One main reason for this was the growing number of reporters on the scene. Already during Kosovo war there were a lot more individuals and teams requesting a press card. The waiting in the cue was a moment to contemplate about quitting: the sheer mass of reporters meant that everything was done much slower, as it was much more difficult to guarantee the safety of everyone. As this mass of journalists travelled to Pristina in convoy, she felt that she could not add anything about the tale of the conflict, only the risk to be shot remained. Nevertheless, with the current gulf of violence in the Middle-East, Daniels currently contemplates a freelance return to one of the core battlefields of the world.</p>
