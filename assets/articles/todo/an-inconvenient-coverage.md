<p style="text-align: justify;">These last few years, the world has seen its share of major international problems. The War on Terror, the troubles in the Middle-East, and the global economic crisis have dominated much of the global news during the past decade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Usually, the media coverage of these events was good. We have seen the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan unfold before our eyes and received regular updates on the number of deaths. Our reporters were at the frontlines of the Arab Spring, risking their lives on numerous occasions. We know which organisations and banks are responsible for our financial sores, and can follow each step taken on the path to economic salvation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But has anyone heard much from the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/homepage.aspx">Doha 2012</a> climate conference?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the continuous calls for action and the repeated doomsday reports, not much attention has been devoted to global warming. Even BBC World covered only the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/science-environment-20492501">opening</a> of the Doha conference. One week later, we haven't received any updates, despite the fact that a member of the Commonwealth is <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/pakistans_climate_change_challenge">already confronted</a> with the consequences of climate change.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/tumblr_medrtgW23T1rmrpico1_1280.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1591" title="tumblr_medrtgW23T1rmrpico1_1280" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/tumblr_medrtgW23T1rmrpico1_1280-300x298.jpg" width="300" height="298" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, our media are only capable of  blaming people after the damage is done, as the economic crisis showed. Proper investigative journalism has become  rare. And where there is no supply, the demand will gradually disappear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So probably no change in media behaviour will occur as long as climate change does not start causing <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Hurricane_Sandy#United_States_2" target="_blank">even bigger damage in the West</a>. As a consequence we all continue to ignore the situation we know we will have to face in the not-so-distant future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why is global news still the news of the Western World? Why is there an extensive coverage of international politics and economics, but not of our shared global environment?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Probably because of the simple rule that the only news worth telling is the news provided by the powerful.  Only rarely have media escaped this. Internally our media has democratized significantly, but on a global scale we still see only the interests of the rich and mighty, meaning our own. This is why the environment only receives minimal coverage. Just as with global poverty, we know the problem but prefer to ignore it. The general attitude is one of  "no coverage, no cry".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the impasse we're at. Mainstream media have no interest in increasing the supply of useful and important information, and the public doesn't create a demand for it. And for the moment, this suits both parties just fine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But we know this cannot hold. Breaking the deadlock has become an urgent necessity. And if the mainstream media doesn't do it, we will. Only then will we have a truly global media to cover our global problems.</p>
