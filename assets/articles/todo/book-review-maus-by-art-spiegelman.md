<p>Historians consider themselves lucky. Although they spend an awful lot of time in dusty archives, ploughing through tons of old documents, they sometimes get rewarded with what is called a ‘historical sensation’. What causes this very specific feeling is usually the discovery of a document hand-written by the king, or a secret battle plan, maybe even a mistress’s love letter. It is the sensation of having a direct connection to important events of the past, of being a front row witness to history itself.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_355" align="alignleft" width="250"]<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347117001&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=maus"><img class="size-full wp-image-355  " title="250px-Maus" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/250px-Maus.jpeg" width="250" height="348" /></a> Click to Buy[/caption]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But besides this happy sentiment, historians also have other history-related feelings. They sometimes face humanity’s most abhorrent aspects and have to deal with the idea that mankind can do unimaginable things. This is especially true for historians of the modern era, and they do their utmost best to understand such events. But the historian is rarely the right person for conveying these historical emotions to the wider public.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For this task one needs artists.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Art_Spiegelman">Art Spiegelman</a> has without doubt created one of the best emotional representations of history. In 1973 the first part of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347117001&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=maus"><em>Maus</em></a> was published, the story of his own present and his father’s past. In this Pulitzer-winning comic book (or what we now would call a graphic novel) Vladek Spiegelman tells the story of how he survived the Holocaust. Dealing with all aspects of it, from the terrible uncertainty of the early years to the true horror later on, Vladek captures like no other the full extent of history’s worst hour. In this setup, his son Art is presented as the observer – the person who registers the story and brings it to a wider audience through his drawings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But despite taking up this humble role, Art Spiegelman fulfills it to perfection. What strikes the reader most is his brutal honesty. Although the book is famous for representing each of the involved ethnicities or nationalities with animal faces (Germans as cats, Jews as mice), it is Spiegelman’s ability to portray the full story that makes his work truly special.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vladek Spiegelman is portrayed as a greedy, moaning old man, stuck in his old ways and giving a hard time to his son and new wife. Near the end of the book, he is shown complaining about a black hitchhiker in his car; the survivor of ethnical violence is not free of racist beliefs himself. These added details are what make <em>Maus</em> so credible. Each of the main characters has so many layers, so many lifelike qualities, that you are constantly reminded of the fact that, despite their appearance, you are reading about people who once existed and not mere literary characters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And because of this, the pure madness hits home twice as hard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the story picks up speed, the tale becomes unimaginable. The family ignoring war and trying to live just as before. The grandparents hidden in the shed. Near arrests only avoided by cold-blooded thinking and sheer luck. Ten thousand people sent to the camps at once. The constant need for food and money. Doubts about where your son might be safe. Collaborators sacrificing their peers in order to save themselves. The camps. After a while all what remains is the urge to survive, even if you've seen death all around you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All these elements of the holocaust are well-known, but it is Spiegelman’s style that brings them to life. Near the end, the reader realizes that, besides a talent for survival, the only thing that kept Vladek Spiegelman alive was pure luck. And he also realizes that should he have lived through such events himself, he probably would have been one of the numerous deaths in the story, not the lucky survivor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Art Spiegelman makes you believe that every death in the book could have been yours. And there is no escape from that feeling, nowhere to hide from it. Only the brutal truth remains, just as it did between 1938 and 1945.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides being a perfect observer – involved yet truthful, Spiegelman has brought the rawness of conflict to the fore. <em>Maus</em> is a must read for anyone interested in war and violence, as it puts the reader in the position of the victim.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Art Spiegelman has done more than capture the emotions of history; he has created a timeless historical sensation. Only one of the not so happy kind.</p>
