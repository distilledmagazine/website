<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Shades-of-Blue1.jpeg"><img class="alignleft" title="Shades of Blue" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Shades-of-Blue1.jpeg" width="300" height="300" /></a>What do you think of when you see these colors?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blue. I think of blue. Of course, I'm very well aware that these are different colors, and that some colors, such as the one in the upper right-hand corner begin to wander toward green. Yet, if I was pressed by a stranger on the street for the colors on this palette, I would immediately respond blue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But, that's not the case for a Russian. The Russian would consider the dark blues and the light blues as two different colors — as different as green and blue for us. Other cultures such as some of the tribes in Papua New Guinea would consider these blues as well as all the violets and a large number of greens as 'black'.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why? One hypothesis is that people from different cultures perhaps see color differently from each other, but when subjected to a test asking to distinguish between these colors, they would do just as well as anyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The answer is not biological. It's cultural.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, the Russian language has two words for blue. Dark blue is '<em>siniy</em>'. Light blue is '<em>goluboy</em>'. For other languages, the distinction between green and blue is blurred by a word that approximates in English as 'grue'.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/spectrum3.jpeg"><img class="alignright" title="spectrum3" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/spectrum3.jpeg" width="340" height="234" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Consider the visible spectrum to the right. While we subdivide the spectrum into Red - Orange - Yellow - Green - Blue - Indigo - Violet (the Mr Roy G. Biv of primary school fame), other cultures would choose a completely different grouping of colors for the rainbow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Personally, I never quite understood 'indigo'. My indifference to 'indigo' is actually indicative of the way language influences the way we perceive the world. If you showed me 'indigo' on a placard, I would be inclined to just call it 'purple'. Only when boxed into a corner would I rummage my memory to scavenge 'indigo' under the pile of Crayola colors I have long forgotten.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Guy Deutscher in <em><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345758740&amp;sr=8-1">Through the Language Glass</a>,</em> his excellent follow-up to <em><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345758772&amp;sr=1-1">The Unfolding of Language</a></em> (worthy of a blog-post itself), uses this example of  colors and their labels to take us through an engaging history of how people have investigated how language influences the way we perceive the world. This history includes such unlikely names as Homer, Prime Minister Gladstone (an extraordinary scholar, classicist, and writer before meeting the love of his life Disraeli), and Whorf (Benjamin, and not the Klingon).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deutscher makes it slow-going at first, spending much of the first chapter dispelling the reader's assumption that speaking French, for example, may prevent one from expressing an idea that falls out in every inane babbling of a German speaker. While an overload of names and examples in the first chapter may seem a bit pedantic, Deutscher's intentions are soon made clear once he leaps into the first part of the book — a section devoted to exploring color.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the end of the book, Deutscher through both anthropological and linguistic examples and astonishing thought experiments allows the reader to personally confront the central thesis of the book: language doesn't prevent us from expressing any idea, but does force us to express things in different ways that filter how we see the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, English forces its speakers to specify whether they 'speak', 'are speaking', 'will speak', etc. Whereas in French, the three previous examples would fall under the remit of '<em>ils parlent</em>'.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wait, did you catch what I missed there? I used the French third-person plural '<em>ils</em>' for the English 'they'. But when you read the English sentence, who did you picture in your head when I said 'they'? Was it a single man, a single woman, a group of men, a group of women, or a group of mixed gender? Or was it you? In English, 'they' can mean a lot of different things depending on the context, but in French '<em>ils</em>' has a much more specific definition. Additionally, if I wanted to specify a group of females, and females only, I would have used '<em>elles</em>' for 'they', and not '<em>ils</em>', which is used for a group of men or a group of mixed gender.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a more bizarre and, quite frankly, disorienting example, Deutscher explains how certain tribes of Australia use cardinal directions 'North, East, West, and South' rather than left, right, front, and back. So if you were facing north, you would refer to your left hand as your 'west' hand. If you then turned 'west', your left hand would suddenly become your 'south' hand. Surely the world must seem different in a world where directions aren't framed around the speaker. Could you imagine how much easier giving directions would be if we used an observer, or even better cardinal, frame when we spoke? Taking directions on the other hand...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I've only scratched the surface of the many examples Deutscher uses to illustrate his thesis. As I neared the end of the book, I soon became anxious. Deutscher was clearly describing a rapidly evolving field of study, given the recency of his citations. The science seemed forthcoming, yet still absent. Deutscher, to his credit, responds to this potential criticism in the conclusion of his book by explaining that brain science, despite the fantastical claims of some excitable sorts at The New Yorker, is still notoriously unreliable. It's still science, but the conclusions are not yet as unassailable as we are often led to believe by the three-ring circus of science journalism.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deutscher's concluding remarks are a breath of fresh air — a direct rebuke to viewing science as a mere menagerie of wonders, a <em>wunderkammer</em> of the 21st century. Instead he reaffirms that science is foremost about the process and the joys of ever-deepening curiosity. As a former scientist myself, I cannot help but recommend this conclusion and Deutscher's book.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a postscript, I would like to quickly sketch a potential frame for understanding political language based on some of what Deutscher describes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Much of what Deutscher illuminates about how language influences the way we see the world can be applied to the realm of political language. For example, the existence of a particular word to describe some aspect of democracy or liberty makes it easier to debate how these values ought to be defended or enhanced. A richer political language lends depth to any civic dialogue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At this point, you may be reminded of George Orwell and <em>1984. </em>In the book, Orwell posits that if a word does not exist to describe a specific concept, then you can't protest when it is abrogated:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">'In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible because there will be no words in which to express it'.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Can't fight something you can't see, right?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, I would argue that Orwell was wrong as anyone can describe even the most baroque bits of Heidegger with more or less words than the original German (don't dismiss Orwell on language yet, his classic <em><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/orwell46.htm"  ">Politics and the English Language</a></em> remains a must-read!).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What I would like to argue is that the application of a richer language in politics is similar to distinguishing between various shades of blue. Sure, I could mark the distinction between any two different concepts, but having the words to describe the distinction would hone my mind to more quickly identify the differences, and more importantly, to manipulate those concepts myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the continuing quest to reclaim what bland technocratic politics has taken from us, we must learn the difference between '<em>siniy</em>' and '<em>goluboy</em>'. And we must learn to speak the difference often.</p>
