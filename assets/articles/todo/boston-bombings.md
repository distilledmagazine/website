<p>Newsworthiness - of sufficient interest or importance to the public to warrant reporting in the media. That’s all it means. I would’ve thought that the term newsworthiness carried with it some sense of responsibility or duty, maybe even a hint of integrity. With a few weeks to reflect on the fallout of the Boston bombings, here are a few of my notes:</p>
<p>The conservative take: See, the crazies of this world will always find ways to hurt Americans. We can finally put this so-called “gun control debate” to rest. As if there ever was one.</p>
<p>The liberal take: You think this is bad? U.S. military drones are doling out attacks like this on the daily. And what’s more, they’re coming soon to a town near you!</p>
<p>So far, the pundits will only use this tragedy as an opportunity to further their own agenda. Whatever, they’re pundits; I guess I’m not supposed to be surprised anymore. What did surprise me was the lack of consistent reporting during the bombings. Everywhere I looked, it seemed a radically different series of events had taken place. I was 12 years-old on 9/11, so I don’t really remember how the story played out on televisions the world over. Was it similarly disorienting, misleading, and scary?</p>
<p>The scoop has always been the holy grail of journalism; the digital age hasn’t changed that. Technology has made getting a bona fide scoop more difficult, but as time passes it doesn’t seem as relevant. There’s more than enough room for a new paradigm: where a reputation for integrity in reporting will matter more to the masses than the latest and greatest <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/whats-up-with-weezy/" target="_blank">line of digital bullshit</a>.</p>
<p>We will never be able to make sense of what happened in Boston. It doesn’t appeal to the better angels of our nature, and it shouldn’t. If you want, we can blame it all on those pesky Muslims and perpetuate a military industrial conflict that has ruthlessly handicapped our generation. We could go on a full-fledged witch hunt for every <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/authorities_under_suspect_guard_y2m8cJO29uC2PDGIjYBalO">brown person</a> we see in a 5 mile radius. Or we could do the thing that the media doesn’t want to talk about - grieve. We can grieve without seeking revenge, we can heal without bitterness, and we can move on together, stronger than before.</p>
