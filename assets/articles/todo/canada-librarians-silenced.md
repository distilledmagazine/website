<p>The musty odour of untouched parchment wafts romantically to the senses of an unabashedly proud introvert. Row upon row, pleasing the obsession, stemming the compulsion; standing as a bold defiance to disorder. If anything is needed, it lies at the fingertips of the curators of these files detailing cultural depths that not even Google could procure from. The individuals here are guarded, but once their rigorous standards are met, and your purpose satisfactorily justified, they will be some of your most important allies.</p>
<p>While researching my master’s thesis in London, I had the fortunate position of spending day after day interacting with the life and times of the history of United Kingdom and its colonies in the National Archives. The librarians there made the experience. Meticulous in every detail of their work it is as if they had been born with embedded protocols to govern how information and physical documents are dealt with. The goal, well met, of this monotony of course being to ensure that this wealth of information remains available to those whose privilege will follow in the decades and centuries to come.</p>

<p>I spent many minutes, hours, and uncounted time procrastinating in conversation with the staff who guard a figurative and literal vault of knowledge, integral to a national identity. They are not only interesting and among the most helpful staff I have had the fortune of meeting, but love their jobs, truly, more than those I know in most other professions. Although they will be shy to admit it.</p>
<p>This is why my heart goes out to the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/library-and-archives-canada" target="_blank">guardians of the archives of my own homeland,</a> Canada. The government, officially rebranded several years ago from “The Government of Canada” to “The Harper Government” (because Justin Bieber’s <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/justin-bieber-hopes-anne-frank-would-have-been-a-belieber">comments at Anne Frank Huis</a> are not, in fact the greatest act of Canadian egoism), has made librarians their <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/watch?v=7V-wNpzhBNU" target="_blank">latest target for coerced civil servant partisan loyalty</a>.</p>
<p>Civil servants are of course always expected to have a certain amount of tact. They are not activists, and they are tasked with making the country run. <strong>The distinction between being a cog in the wheels of a nation’s machinery of governance, is very different than being co-opted into the mission of the governing party — which is what is happening now in Canada.</strong></p>
<p>As professionals of a densely networked field, closely related to academia, archivists and librarians are understandably highly engaged in things like conferences and public research. They take their usually hidden charisma to schools and publications to help those of us with an intolerance for intense organisation get to know their misunderstood occupation and our own histories. Canadian bookworms, I am proud to say, are some of the best in the world at these things. Or rather, they will have been.</p>
<p>“High risk” is the term used now by the government issued document to describe anywhere these knowledgeable individuals could be seen or heard. It is stressed they have a “duty of loyalty” to the “elected government” (elected by less than 40% of the population) which is now deciding how they use their formerly “personal” time. Approval will be needed where it was not before, if they want to attend a conference on any topic, participate in a society, or do so much as run a blog online — even one that is not public, or one that is anonymous.</p>
<p>Canadian librarians are being told to mind their books. I am certain they are fine with doing so. They will assuredly, however, be saddened at the news they will be helping fewer and fewer of the curious among us do the same.</p>
