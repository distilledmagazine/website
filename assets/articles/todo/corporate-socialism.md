<p dir="ltr">As much as free-marketeers may extol the virtues of a deregulated private market, many fail to acknowledge the practical functioning of large corporations within these markets. In an analogy sure to inspire revulsion among many conservative economists, large corporations, such as Wal-Mart and Coca-Cola, share more in common with large centrally planned economies like the former Soviet Union than they do with the free market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Historical experience has taught us that there are several weaknesses to having a centrally planned economy and organizational structure. Internal competition is scant, and individual autonomy is severely limited. Wal-Mart training videos are a lot like brainwashing by Big Brother from <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/5470.1984" target="_blank">1984</a>. Employees do have the choice of quitting their jobs and moving to another employer, yet for most people, this theoretical freedom of choice merely moves from one fiefdom to another. The conditions set by the lords of these corporate fiefs are much the same, and the probability of escaping from these conditions once entrenched within them is small.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most importantly, centrally planned organizations suffer from an inherent compulsion towards oligarchy. When decisions are made among a relatively small group of people, all the power that is bound up within the unseen ineffable spirit that permeates any organization becomes concentrated among the few.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The true danger of large corporations is the very size and monolithic structure. People’s senses are dulled in the face of the sheer magnitude of the structures that bind them. Being a small cog in a big centrally planned machine leaves one feeling drained of free will and agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">When centrally administered incentive structures dehumanize people at various points of the hierarchy, how do these corporations manage the complexity inherent in large organizations?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Corporations share the same hubristic belief with Soviet central planners that careful systematic data-driven management, the latest innovations in management science, and the inculcation of a belief in the organization’s driving mission can achieve its economic mission. Corporate central planning even comes with the requisite five-year plans and advanced computerized modelling (ala <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Project_Cybersyn" target="_blank">Project CyberSyn</a>, an effort to computerize decision making, in Chile). They believe that big data and a technocratic approach to governance can solve any problem of organization, while ensuring consistent and enduring profit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">There isn’t anything inherently wrong with being a large organization with a mission. It’s only problematic when the large organization’s mission revolves around delivering a profit to shareholders. By virtue of seeking to fulfill a purely measurable monetary goal that large corporations tend toward an oligarchical centrally planned structure. It is no different than the attempts at pure productive efficiency in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Large organizations ought to revolve around missions that are grander and more fulfilling to the human spirit. One aspect of why nation-states have been successful is that they unite people around the greater human values of patriotism, duty, and a commitment to national community, rather than just increasing the wealth of the nation. In order to achieve some of these values, countries foster unplanned activity, entrepreneurship, competing poles of power, and accountability. If you center your large organization around values rather than mere profit, you are much more likely to reap the efficiency and stability benefits of decentralization.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many big corporations cannot reasonably claim that they are fulfilling a larger humanitarian goal, and are thus prone to massive bureaucracy and centralized power. Large corporations operating in an unregulated free market are anything but decentralized. If we are honest, corporate socialism ought to be any conservative’s worst nightmare.</p>
