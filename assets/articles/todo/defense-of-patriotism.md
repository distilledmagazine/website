<p>I was seventeen years old in November of 2004 when George W. Bush was<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/United_States_presidential_election,_2004" target="_blank"> reelected President of the United States of America.</a> Oh, the indignant rage that filled my idealistic heart! I would move to Canada, my cry went out, joining progressives across the nation, if only I were a few years older...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moving to Canada has long been the half-joking solution bandied about in progressive circles whenever an election doesn't go our way. Canada, where people seem to care about the common good, where the populace isn't so married to their guns, where single-payer healthcare is not just a pipe dream! But elections have come and gone. We have lost many more battles than we have won, yet there has been no lefty exodus across the northern border.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">What compels us to stay? It might mostly be the hassle of picking up and moving to a new place, but I would put forth that there is also a force at work that most progressives are loathe to admit: patriotism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">George Bernard Shaw famously wrote, "Patriotism, fundamentally, is a conviction that a particular country is the best in the world because you were born in it." Many of us take it as a given that everyone should hold their own country in high esteem, mostly because we are taught that patriotism is an important virtue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">President Obama, at the beginning of his presidency, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/oe-kirchick28" target="_blank">offered his views </a>on love of country while touring Europe: "I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism." The president wasn't, in fact, talking about American exceptionalism, which is a belief that the United States has a special role to play in the spreading of democracy. He was instead talking about American patriotism, the idea that Americans can love America above all other nations, even while acknowledging that outsiders love their homelands with equal fervor. Does that make our love arbitrary, as Shaw might argue? I think not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">What is it that makes us "American"? Birth? Citizenship? Belief in certain ideals? While these may be the most common answers to the question, none quite captures the essence of what might unite me, a Southern second-generation immigrant, with a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/White_Anglo-Saxon_Protestant" target="_blank">WASP</a> from New England.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Patriotism for those of us who critically engage in public discourse is an expression of the roots we have set down for ourselves within our communities. We have a duty, we have an allegiance, and most importantly, we have a vision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Our groundedness in this nation means that we are called to grapple with the legacy of genocide and Jim Crow as well as a present system that seems to break down more than function, but one thing that we all share as Americans is a hope in a collective vision for the future. We may differ on what that vision might be, but what is truly important is that we have a vision in the first place. We accept this place as our home, and we want to ensure that it becomes everything that we might dream for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It doesn't matter that there are any number of countries in this world that offer similar levels of freedom to the US; as an American I have a responsibility to wrestle with my compatriots to make sure that this place and its people are all that they can be.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>And wrestle I must! It's possible to cry out against the military industrial complex while offering respect and compassion to our veterans. It's possible to fight for gun control while acknowledging the sanctity the second amendment holds in many hearts. It's possible to protect multiculturalism while still holding onto what it is that makes us American. A progressive vision for the future must strive to embrace the possibilities of a future in which all the voices is this diverse nation are heard. We may yet turn this nation into a great experiment in progressive policy, as can progressives all over the world in whatever nation they call home. In the meantime, we should relish the process of becoming.</p>
