<p>It is easy to look at the Detroit bankruptcy and simply declare that there are no winners in bankruptcy. The rights of pensioners, who may lose a significant portion of their retirement incomes and medical coverage, are balanced against the rights of the city to govern and have a fresh start at reinvention. It is a familiar story of bankruptcy where everyone loses, where we pick the lesser of evils. It makes everyone feel a bit better about sacrificing and allows the lawyers and businesspeople to take a serious, solemn tone of admonishment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that it simply is not true in any form of bankruptcy. Bankruptcy payouts are determined by carefully-crafted legal relationships. Those who will be making serious sacrifices are largely those who did not have the power or organization to ensure their rights. Take corporate bankruptcy of a limited liability corporation (LLC) for example. The owners have little to fear because the LLC guarantees that personal property will not be jeopardized as equity of a failed business is worthless anyway. Major creditors, with property lines against the business’s assets, will be strongly favored in bankruptcy and can negotiate accordingly. Pensioners and minor creditors are left holding the bag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="break">The Detroit sovereign bankruptcy is no different. We are not looking at shared sacrifice amongst all interested parties; we are looking at severe, unbalanced sacrifice by parties that did not have the ability to abandon a sinking ship. The “owners” of a city are its residents, but those residents are increasingly only those without the ability to move away.</p>
<p class="break">
<p>As <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/55976062830" target="_blank">former Labor Secretary Robert Reich argues</a>, the Detroit bankruptcy is a symptom of a larger trend of economic segregation:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Americans are segregating by income more than ever before. Forty years ago, most cities (including Detroit) had a mixture of wealthy, middle-class, and poor residents. Now, each income group tends to lives separately in its own city — with its own tax bases and philanthropies that support, at one extreme, excellent schools, resplendent parks, rapid-response security, efficient transportation, and other first-rate services; or, at the opposite extreme, terrible schools, dilapidated parks, high crime, and third-rate services.”</p></blockquote>
<p class="break">Those who can afford to leave are escaping to build utopian suburbs, while those who cannot are left to suffer starved services and failing schools.</p>
<p class="break">
<p>The data support Secretary Reich’s position. While media reports have focused on the inevitability of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/detroit-becomes-biggest-u-s-city-to-file-for-bankruptcy.html" target="_blank">Detroit’s bankruptcy</a> by citing 78,000 abandoned buildings and a population that has fallen from a peak of 1.85 million in 1950 to about 700,000 today; this is <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2569481" target="_blank">a story of flight</a> to the suburbs, not flight from the Detroit metropolitan area as a whole. While the Detroit city population fell by 62%, the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Metro_Detroit" target="_blank">metro Detroit</a> area grew by 42% from 1950-2012. Oakland county, just northwest of Detroit, is the fourth richest county in the United States with a population over one million. The tax base fell not because people were moving out of the area, but because people were moving away from the city.</p>

<p>People may have every right to decide where they live and with whom they share a town, but this is not a story of shared sacrifice. It is a story of haves and have-nots. Detroit’s bankruptcy was inevitable because the vast majority of wealthier residents decided to start towns anew, rather than reforming the existing city to meet their vision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In choosing to exercise their right of exit, they are imposing an external cost on the people left behind, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/story?id=19716119" target="_blank">threatening the right </a>under the Michigan constitution for workers to be paid their pension obligations as contracted. Often well beyond their working years, these pensioners have no opportunity to make up for lost income. Through no fault of their own, every bankruptcy negotiation is a pure loss for pensioners who have already fulfilled their part of the bargain. Meanwhile, the residents of suburban Detroit stand to lose nothing. It is not their services that are threatened nor their obligation to pay Detroit taxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="break">The Detroit bankruptcy is a symptom of the breakdown of a common system of local governance. It threatens the very idea that local government is an effective way to provide services. Although local governance maximizes the ability of residents to participate in local decisions (as transportation systems have improved and jobs have moved out of the inner-city), it has increasingly allowed people to shop for the ideal municipality. Why pay for services you don’t need when you can move to a gated community where they are unnecessary?</p>
<p class="break">
<p>Much as buying a house allows the owner to avoid wasting money on rent, buying a house in a high-income town allows the owner to avoid wasting money on paying for services for those less fortunate. It is, in a way, an investment. The demand created by this “investment opportunity” drives housing values up, which in turn drives out even more people who may need social services. In the end, the logical result is exactly what we see in the Detroit Metropolitan area. The poorest residents are isolated in a pocket of need; the outcasts that no one wants on their team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should be no surprise that the outcasts are not self-sustaining. A model of small, competing municipalities does not work in governance as it does in an economy. Inherent to competition is that someone loses. Municipalities should not and cannot compete for residents because municipalities should not and cannot fail. The system is working exactly as we would expect it to work; Detroit is the obsolete, undesired competitor that should fail to ensure the health of the system. Unlike the economy, that failure is unacceptable and cruel, imposing costs in an indefensible and unbalanced way. The only aspect that is shared in this debacle is the ethical bankruptcy of a system gone bad.</p>
