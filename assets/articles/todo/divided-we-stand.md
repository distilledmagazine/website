<p style="text-align: justify;">Once every while this society discovers that her youth is not in the least interested in her. Then she responds with outrage and all kinds of threats for the future. A youth that is not interested in politics is prone to fall for populist politicians, thinking in black-and-white and hollow slogans. And of course we all know the cause of all this indifference: Education! Let’s change policies! More debate at the breakfast table, more teacher- and parenthood and less listening to the education experts...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Those ideas aren’t bad in themselves, they just won’t change much. Even if you organise exams at that breakfast table, or completely disband the ministries of education, with their overpaid experts, the better part of this generation still won’t be interested in this society. The real problem is a bit more complex and more difficult to solve than you might think. Take for example the idea that unity is good, that dissension is bad. Who could doubt it? No greater horror than a society divided, right? Anyone who disagrees should quickly go and watch Lincoln with his/her children!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It's not that simple though. Take for example that part of history where conservative critics often look back to with a sort of nostalgia, the immediate post-war period — long before May 1968 and those terrible postmodernists who rose up in its wake.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the 1950s, there was still something like a common body of knowledge. A canon of facts we could consider ours, something we shared with the others. If there has been an age in which society was divided, it was this one. Socialists, catholics, liberals,… all were prepared to fight each other with words or anything else to defend their beliefs. Governments had an average lifespan of less than a year, slogans – cheap or otherwise – were shouted in the streets and cafés.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ideology determined public and private life more than anything else, from breakfast table to bar, from pulpit to parliament and palace. Based on someone’s political views, you could tell who that person was, where he/she stood, what you could say and what not, and where you could say it and on which tone. You knew with who you’d better shut up and where you ran a risk of getting smacked in the head. Today, that almost sounds idyllic. What is unthinkable today used to be very common... Division united us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The hostile debates of the ‘50s and ‘60s were rapidly replaced by an atmosphere of conviviality. The end of ideologies was proclaimed. Political debates quickly became endless empty chats between boring managers, who’s only weapons were surveys and sociological research. Their goal was not to defend what they believe in, but to serve the stakeholders. Left and Right meant no more than different ways of reaching that goal, they were different strategies, nothing more. Not a reason to take offence. Right?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The one thought that has dominated politics and public life is the thought that says that the own opinion is relative. "Oh excuuuse me! Just expressing a personal opinion here!" You don’t have to be a nostalgic conservative to see that this hasn’t solved all problems. That atmosphere of conviviality turned into overstressed political correctness. Not perseverance, intellectual honesty, or respect but bitter cynicism has become the underlying tone of public life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything we say is analysed for a hidden meaning and agenda. And those who dare to disagree too much are under suspicion for taking their own opinion too serious. Intolerable! We are an open and tolerant society, and he/she who disagrees with that can be publicly flogged! The pendulum has swung to the opposite side and way beyond it… Today, nothing divides us more than unity.</p>
