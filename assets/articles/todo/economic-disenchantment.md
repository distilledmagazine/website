<p dir="ltr">As the political system threatens to tear down an economy that already refuses to recover, it is important to reflect on the geographic impacts of our economic policies.  Are we really surprised that rural voters, devastated by decades of economic policies that favor the urban over the rural, express their disillusionment through obstructionism?  It was predictable, and it was ignored by economists, but rural disillusionment needs to be addressed head on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Economic geography considers economic policies in light of the differing impacts they have depending on geographic area.  In the most general and easily communicable economic theory, geography is a complication that is ignored.  Geographic impacts are more specific than a simple abstract model can analyze.  Unfortunately, this level of abstraction is seriously misleading under the American political institutions, where economic geography is inseparable from political outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In Senate, House, and Presidential elections, constitutional rules make it so that geographical boundaries give rural voters an outsized impact on political decisions.  In the Senate, smaller states that tend to have a higher proportion of rural to urban voters have more votes per person.  The provision of two senators per state allows four states in the Western plains region—Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming—to have the same influence on the senate as the four most populous states—California, Florida, New York, and Texas.  The 3.1 million residents of these Western plains states have 33 times the influence per person as those of our most populous states.  The residents of Wyoming alone have a whopping <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population" target="_blank">69 times as much influence per person</a> as those of California.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Presidential election tilts influence towards smaller states for similar underlying reasons as the Senate.  The voters of the Electoral College that convenes to elect every U.S. President are apportioned according to the number of Congressmen per state.  As a result, the advantage that smaller states have in the number of Senators per resident transfers through to the Electoral College.  Furthermore, the winner-take-all nature of most states’ selection of electors puts the centers of the top 5 metropolitan areas in states that are generally ignored by Presidential campaigns.  Other than interstate suburbs of Chicago, the 54 million citizens of these metropolitan areas, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities_and_metropolitan_areas_of_the_United_States" target="_blank">one sixth of the U.S. population, have virtually no marginal impact on presidential elections</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The House was designed to allow for population to speak more equally, regardless of their state affiliation.  As the following graph shows, it is generally true that population per representative does not change significantly from more to less populous states.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Population per U.S. Representative in each state or district, ranked by population from largest (left) to smallest.  Washington, D.C., #50, has no House representation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pop_per_rep.png" target="_blank">Chart link here</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, even though House seats are apportioned among states by population, states have been required to elect representatives within <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/2c" target="_blank">geographic districts since 1967</a>.   In these geographic districts, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/opinion/sunday/the-great-gerrymander-of-2012.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1380446154-4bz8AfgPW8QhZWw3So7wQQ" target="_blank">[c]oncentration of voters in urban areas can, for example, limit how districts are drawn, creating a natural packing effect,</a>” where packing is placing a large majority of voters for one party in a district so that many more votes than necessary for a majority are concentrated in one district.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In other words, where cities tend to pack many like-minded voters very close together, it is difficult not to draw geographic districts that minimize the impact of urban voters.  This effect manifested itself in the 2012 elections, where Democrats, who comprise large majorities in most urban areas, won 1.4 million more votes in cumulative House races, while <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/02/house-of-un-representatives/?_r=0" target="_blank">Republicans won 33 more seats</a> in those races.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">House districts that concentrate voters of urban and rural districts also tend to allow their representatives to take more extreme positions than the general population.  Without fearing electoral reprisal, representatives may drive their positions towards the extremes of each party.  Where there is a strong urban-rural divide in representative districts, we might expect to see <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/09/house-gop-does-house-gop-est-thing-ever.html" target="_blank">more extreme positions</a> in both ideological directions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although some of these political institutions may be reformed, most of them are hardwired into the American political system.  Certainly, there will be no change of Senate allocation in the foreseeable future.  More balanced congressional redistricting is possible, but widespread change would be extraordinarily difficult to achieve where there will be strong built-in opposition from the party who stands to lose.  Even if reform would be beneficial, major changes are unrealistic.  Disproportionate impact of rural voters on American political outcomes should be taken as given.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Impacts on Political Economy</p>
<p dir="ltr">Given the outsized impact of rural voters, it is particularly strange that economic analyses generally do not consider the possibility of disparate effects on rural and urban communities that will create dissatisfied and disillusioned rural voters.  A typical analysis will declare that a trade policy, tax cut, or regulation promotes “economic efficiency” or “economic growth” without considering the secondary impacts that the policy may have in undermining political functioning.  It will try to evaluate the economy as if it is fundamentally separable from politics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the American system, economic efficiency and political functioning are so entangled that one cannot be analyzed without considering the other.  Economists and analysts who lean heavily on the idea that they are delivering “positive economics,” rather than “normative” political considerations are merely covering their analyses from the consequences of their actions.  Economic predictions that have obvious political impacts cannot be analyzed as if those impacts will not happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">An example is the description of the transitioning American economy from a manufacturing economy to a knowledge and service economy.  As explained by adjunct professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley,<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/made-america-middle-class-built-manufacturing-jobs/story?id=12916118&amp;singlePage=true" target="_blank"> this transition is “not unusual</a>.  If you look at what happens to a country as it becomes wealthier, you totally expect to see an increase in the share of services and a decrease in the share of goods.”  In terms of direct economic impacts, there may be little reason for concern that value is being created in services, but in terms of geography, this transition is a potential catastrophe.  A manufacturing economy is based in many rural and semi-rural communities, while a knowledge and service economy is based predominantly in urban centers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">We cannot claim to be surprised when rural voters become disillusioned and begin to use their outsized impact on the federal government for obstructionism.  What else would we possibly expect?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Put yourself in the shoes of a typical rural voter.  Nearly one-third of the jobs in the manufacturing sector have disappeared since 2000, after providing steady non-urban employment for decades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Even as the productivity of the workforce has skyrocketed, the real median family income, a true measure of the typical voter, has stagnated for years, even as Americans have worked longer hours.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, there is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matt-vasilogambros/rural-brain-drain-iowa_b_830352.html" target="_blank">a general brain drain in rural areas</a>, especially in the Midwest and Great Plains states, as college-educated youth flood into metropolitan areas in search of higher wages in the growing knowledge economy.  Disillusioned?  Why wouldn't they be disillusioned?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As those rural voters lash out through their representatives this week, it is important to realize that this intransigence does not come from nowhere.  It was obvious; it was predictable; and most often, it was ignored when an economist assured you that a policy was efficient.</p>
