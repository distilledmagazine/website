<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>‘Cataluña tiene sentido común, es sensata y responsable’</em>. Catalonia keeps a common feeling, it is sensible and responsible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This sentiment, expressed by <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/el-pp-cree-que-artur-mas-queda-desautorizado-y-con-un-pie-en-el-paro-1276475223">Alicia Sánchez Camacho</a>, figurehead of the Partido Popular in Catalonia, must have been widely shared on Sunday.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the separatists of<strong> </strong>Convergencia i Unio (CiU) declared that they aimed for an absolute majority in the Catalan regional elections, tensions in Madrid and Brussels had increased markedly during the last couple of weeks. For neither of the two crisis-struck governments an all-out nationalist victory would have been very welcome. But considering the self-assured attitude of CiU’s leader and Catalan president Artur Mas, and his announcement that a referendum on independence would be held once victory had been secured, things looked grim indeed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To many commentators surprise, and to the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/1353929572_488344.html">outright joy</a> of Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, Mas however <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/a">overplayed his hand</a>. Due to the firm cuts his government has made in response to the crisis, CiU lost 12 seats and is now far removed from an absolute majority. However, another separatist party, the Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC), managed to gain 11 seats with its proposal to impose less stringent austerity measures. The result for Catalonia, Spain, and Europe at large is a status-quo, although the separatist forces are more divided then before.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As of yet, the implications of this result remain unclear. Although Mas declared to keep his promise of organising a referendum, the result of this vote is now much less certain. In their haste to secure an old dream, the Catalan nationalists seem to have hit a crucial breaking point. But given the fact that the CiU and the ERC have a combined majority in the regional assembly, Spanish unity is also not yet in the clear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, there remains an important lesson to learn from these elections. Of the four European regions with a significant support for separatism – Catalonia, Scotland, Flanders, and Northern Italy/ Padania – the Catalan nationalists have the largest electoral basis, but they still struggle to move towards real separation. And democratically securing independence will not be an easy task for any of these four regions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the Scottish SNP, the Flemish NV-A and the Italian Lega Nord have gained massive electoral victories since 2007, none of them has succeeded in transforming this support into concrete results. The Lega Nord suffered from internal turmoil following its participation in the last Berlusconi government, whereas the Flemish nationalists remain exempt from government at the national level. And although the SNP has managed to reach an <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-19942638">agreement</a> on a referendum in 2014, two years is a long time in political terms and the SNP will have to secure further support against the sturdy opposition from the government in London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ironically, the largest problem these groups face is that they enjoy massive support within their region but have to deal with forces outside of it. As was made clear from the outset of the Catalan elections, Spain would have never yielded in the case of an outright CiU victory. Similarly, the EU signalled that a new Catalan state might not become a member right away. Similar tensions exist in Scotland, Flanders, and northern Italy, as separation will always have to be negotiated with the entities they try to break away from.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Being major forces of change, the nationalist parties run the risk of hitting the structures of continuity everywhere they turn. If they do not find a way to deal with the existing national governments and the EU, we might see many more status-quos in the near future.</p>
