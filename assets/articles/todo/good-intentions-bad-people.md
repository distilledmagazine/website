excerpt: We judge others as being good when they do right by more than themselves.
  Good intentions don't negate social evils or power structures that perpetuate them.

<p dir="ltr">What makes someone a “bad person”? All but the most radical among us would say that even if people are inherently good, some just have to be categorized as bad. The categories are obvious to most of us in an “I-know-it-when-I-see-it kind of way”:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Gandhi?   Good.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Hitler?   Bad.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Stalin?   Bad.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">The Dalai Lama?   Good.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> Easy, isn't it? You probably have some not so famous examples from your own experience:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">The guy who always wears a bluetooth in his ear and is terribly unkind to waitstaff?   Bad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">The sweet lady who lives a few doors down that sometimes gives you cookies just because you say hello?   Good.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But even if we agree that most people fall into categories of good or bad, we have to admit that there is a degree of ambiguity in sorting them. Hardly anyone would call themselves a bad person, but they have to exist. Even obnoxious bluetooth guy would try to justify his treatment of others in some way, and his reasoning must have some semblance of logic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Is it fair to lump him in with the other baddies, where <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Pol_Pot1" target="_blank">Pol Pot</a> and your racist uncle reside? And speaking of your racist uncle, does bigotry keep someone out of the good category? <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/abraham-lincoln-racist/?_r=1" target="_blank">Abraham Lincoln was racist</a> in a number of ways, but we tend to say that people are products of their time and give him a pass. But maybe we should give up our hubris enough to realize that the people we think should be more enlightened are also products of their time and place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The hard truth we must face is that it may be in our nature to sort others into “the good” and “the bad,” but most of us fall into a grey area somewhere on the spectrum. Perhaps it would help to define what “good” is, what “bad” is, and even what “evil” is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The mark of a good person is an outward focus that resists basic impulses toward selfishness enough to make life better for others. Taking responsibility for others, not out of obligation, but out of empathy, makes a person virtuous in spite of other character flaws.  Empathy is the highest of all virtues, for it forces us to stop seeing ourselves as the centers of our own universes and make hard ethical decisions. Empathy is at the heart of ethical teachings that have struck a chord for millennia, from <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Confucius#Ethics1" target="_blank">Confucius</a> to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/?ql=2424628151" target="_blank">Jesus</a> to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Categorical_imperative#The_Second_Formulation1" target="_blank">Kant</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">We judge others as being good when they do right not just by themselves, but by the others around them. Indeed, it is only when the good direct their goodness beyond their inner selves that we even can judge them in a positive light.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">And thus we have the logic of the “bad” person defending themselves from their being categorized as such. They know that they do not belong in the “bad” group because they are able to see the goodness inside of them. The rest of us don’t see their good intentions because they never let the goodness out!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Before we define “badness” in a person, we should first define “evil.” If it is rare that an individual would admit that they are a bad person, it is safe to say that for all intents and purposes absolutely no one would say that they are evil, so let’s define evil as something completely different from badness in a way that is not a characteristic of individuals. (As tempting as it may be to just say that evil is an extreme form of badness, it’s more useful for this exercise to give it a different definition).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since we can’t think about evil on an individual level, we have to think about it on the social level. We are all well aware of social evils: racism, sexism, homophobia, and religious prejudice are just a few examples of evils that certainly exist among us but are larger than any individuals. One thing that social evils have in common is that they exist because of systemic injustices that keep the marginalized from upsetting the status quo backed by the powerful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If we take power to mean the ability of some to coerce others into modes of life that aren’t of their own choosing, we can say that social evil serves as a means of guarding power dynamics within societies. It is this mechanism that causes groups within societies to proliferate evil, even when the interactions between individuals are nothing but pleasant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">So if evil only arises from collective actions, what does that say about the people perpetuating them? It is in those moments where individuals give into the evil of systems that they are being bad people. When making decisions that harm the faceless other, they give up any empathy that may characterize their face to face interactions. We only feel comfortable labelling Hitler as evil because he personified a power structure that did a lot of harm to the marginalized in society--he was evil because he spent the bulk of his time wielding power against those who couldn't protect themselves. Most people, on the other hand, are not bad all of the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But we aren’t good all of the time, either. In fact, try as we might to be good, more often than not we are failing. We live in systems of power in society because that is our default mode of being. We are not only at the mercy of systems that are larger than ourselves, but we are molded by them. And so we’re all, in fact, bad people! As staunchly anti-racist and anti-sexist as I may be, I often find myself thinking thoughts that don’t live up to my ideals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to admit to myself that it feels like I’m fighting a losing battle, and I’m sure I’m not alone. But because it is important to me to be a good, empathetic person, I can’t give up my struggle against my own inculturation. Part of being that person means recognizing that those around me are doing the best they can as well, though some are more practiced than others. It is this recognition that we are all trying to be good people at least some of the time that forces us to do our best, which is to try to give others the benefit of the doubt and to strive to stamp out evil where we can.</p>
