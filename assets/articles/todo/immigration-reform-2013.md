<p dir="ltr">The United States is a country that has been known for having high levels of immigration. Our immigrants reinvigorate our spirit and provide us a new piece of identity. Immigration is a beautiful part of our culture, and an inherent part of our story as a people.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, some do not see immigration in this positive light.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One part of our story that we haven’t been able to shake, is the darker <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/nativist">nativist </a>streak that wants to close the door once a certain people have gotten into the country. Whether it was trying to shut out the Irish in the 19th century, or Latinos today, it is an ugly side of us Americans as a people.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some of the reasons behind this resistance to immigration are very real and valid. Chronic unemployment and general lack of opportunity are things that all too many working class Americans face, and feel is due to immigration. These problems  are also unacceptable.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The true villain in this story, therefore, is not our immigrants. It is the US policies and politicians that created economic structures that allow and encourage capital and jobs to move unrestricted -- causing many jobs to move overseas.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We must stop this backlash against people who are not to blame for America’s economic woes It’s time to embrace that the demographics of America are constantly shifting. When I think of immigrants, I particularly think of the DREAMers (undocumented immigrants who under recent proposals would be granted citizenship for having achieved higher education or served in the military.) The limbo in which DREAMers currently reside, to me, is the biggest example of how the United States is failing on immigration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These thousands of youth are still able to achieve higher learning or serve in the military, despite tremendous difficulties. We should be celebrating these achievements with citizenship, not deportation. These are productive members of our society, and people that could help shape the history of this country. We are missing a huge opportunity by forcing them to live in hiding, or worse deporting them.</p>
<p><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/1_photo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5357" alt="Thousands gather in favor of immigration reform" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/1_photo-300x189.jpg" width="300" height="189" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Right now, Republicans in the the Senate -- the “Gang of 8” -- are spearheading proposals for immigration reform. The beltway is abuzz, and it seems like their brand of reform actually has a chance of passing. These proposals are frankly weak. They include a 10 year path to citizenship full of hoops and hurdles and a heavy emphasis on enforcement (even though the net immigration across the Mexican border is currently <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/275334">zero</a>.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">This “Gang of 8” exemplifies everything that is wrong with how Congress is approaching immigration. Exclusive, teeming with privilege, and lacking even a single woman -- this cadre of Senators is now dictating the conversation. The poor, women, and children are some of the groups that most desperately need to come to the United States. And yet, where is their voice at the table?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now, the Boston Marathon bombings and the immigration of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev to the United States are only adding fuel to the flames of opposition to reform. No, The United States is never going to be fully secure. No one can guarantee that you won’t go to work one day, and not come back. It’s something we will never be able to guarantee, no matter how much we militarize our society. And what is the cost of all this paranoia?</p>
<p dir="ltr">The American political class is afraid. It is afraid of taking meaningful action on anything that may hamper their chances of re-election. This is cowardice to the highest degree. Whether it’s guns, climate change, or immigration, the inaction of Washington is costing lives, and it is time that this comes to an end.</p>
<p>America once was a place known for being unafraid, bold, and willing to take risks. Now we cower behind our wall (physical and cultural) unwilling to welcome people to this country who could potentially revitalize us. We desperately need that revitalization, renewal, and hope. Giving new people a chance could do just that. Congress -- I say <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/watch?v=WjWDrTXMgF8">tear down this wall</a>.</p>
