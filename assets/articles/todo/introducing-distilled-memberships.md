<p>If you've been following us for the last several months, you may have noticed a few changes. Like a young child, we've grown. Rather than crawl, we've learned to walk and even run. And as a result, our worldview, our output, and our community has grown as well.</p>
<p>As we start to become engaged with more projects and as our friends and acquaintances grow, we decided that we needed a better way for you, the <strong><em>Distilled</em></strong> community, to keep up-to-date with the latest analysis and commentary from <em><strong>Distilled</strong></em>.</p>
<p>That is why we are launching <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/join-us/"><strong>Distilled Memberships</strong></a>. It's simple to sign-up and free!</p>
<p>Why become a member?</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>You'll receive a weekly newsletter with the latest content from us</strong>, special members-only content, jobs and publication listings, advance notice ofÂ <strong><em>Distilled</em></strong> meetups and events, reminders about upcoming contribution deadlines, and a round-up of interesting content around the web.</span></li>
<li><strong>Membership in the Distilled Network:</strong> an opportunity to meet and potentially collaborate with experts, professionals, and scholars on articles, papers, and other projects.</li>
<li><strong>First shot at submitting articles to our blog and print edition</strong>: We reach out to members first for contributions to both our magazine's web and print editions, and our website.</li>
<li><strong>Inclusion into a global community of people</strong> committed to telling stories and debating contemporary global issues across borders and disciplines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, we believe that membership allows us to slowly <strong>ferment a movement</strong> of people around the world <strong>who seek to envision a brighter, more principled global future</strong>.</p>
<p>Find out more about membership at <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/join-us/">our sign-up page here</a>.</p>
<p>Sign-up takes less than 10 seconds, and be one of the first to join us</p>
