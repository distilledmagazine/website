<p><em>This article is taken from our partner website <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/newswire.kulmun.be" target="_blank">KULMUN Newswire</a>. It was written by Johan Roggeman, a 20-year-old Law student at the KULeuven.</em></p>
<p class="break">Ten years ago, former US president George W. Bush vowed to give the Iraqis a “united, stable and free country”; last Tuesday over 60 people died and 150 were wounded in suicide attacks and car bombings across the country. The 10th anniversary (2003-2013) of the US-led invasion of Iraq is in no way a festive occasion. Despite the fact that Saddam Hussein is hanged and the war officially over since 2011, peace and stability are far from achieved. The KULMUN Newswire analyses the consequences of this carefully orchestrated mistake from a Russian point of view.</p>
<p class="break">The invasion of Iraq started on the eve of March 19, 2003. ‘The coalition of the willing’ – mainly U.S. and British soldiers – engaged in a short yet bloody confrontation with the Iraqi military. What followed was a swift journey to Baghdad, once again turning Highway 80 into the 1991 ‘Highway of Death’. At that time, there was ample room for hope, best remembered by the many images of coalition forces joining the crowds to pull down Saddam’s many statues.</p>
<p>The military success of the first phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom stands in shrill contrast to the subsequent years of “nation building”. Over the past decade, the death toll reaches an estimated total of over 200.000, and many more wounded. The facts of the war and today’s situation in Iraq beg the questions: Why? And was it all worth it?</p>

<p class="break"><strong>Legitimacy.</strong></p>
<p>On February 6, 2003, Secretary of State Colin Powell appeared before the UN Security Council to persuade other countries of the importance to engage a war with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. The much disputed presentation failed to convince key-players such as Russia, China, France and Germany.<br />
The US and British administrations judged the attitude of those ‘non-willing’ naive and self-centered. So regardless of international law and the Security Council’s non-approval, Operation Iraqi Freedom was launched. This unilateral action immediately ruled out any sustainable solution for the whole Mashriq region.</p>
<p>Strangely, the US war rationale was based on two resolutions issued by that same UN body. Security Council resolutions 678 and 687 condemned the Iraqi weapons program and urged the international community to take action. The alledged presence of weapons of mass destruction was the main reason why the US congress adopted the ‘Iraq Resolution’ in 2002, thereby authorizing its president to use military force.</p>
<p>When all military facilities of Saddam Hussein’s regime were discovered and examined, the main pretext for military action completely disappeared. There were no weapons of mass destruction to be found anywhere and many of the evidence Collin Powel showed in his February 6 presentation proved to be wrong or blatant lies.</p>
<p>Key players such as former President George W. Bush and United Kingdom Prim-Minister Tony Blair continue to be avid supporters of the invasion, although the pretext was completely illegal, moreover inexistent. According to Mr. Blair, the Iraqi people would have rebelled against Saddam Hussein anyways – the invasion thus prevented a failing Arab Spring like today’s situation in Syria.</p>
<p class="break"><strong>Geopolitics of the Iraq War.</strong></p>
<p>The ‘coalition of the willing’ invaded Iraq with much bravado, after the defeat of Saddam Hussein a democratic, unified and prosperous nation would rise from the ashes. Both the regional situation and the US hegemonic position would benefit from an intervention according to the Bush administration.</p>
<p>In terms of regional stability the war has had an opposite effect. Instead of an increase in America’s ability to oversee the region, it deteriorated the US influence and has created a political minefield. Today’s anti-western sentiments in the Arab Spring expose this issue.<br />
Not only has the US lost its grip on the region due to its 2001 and 2003 wars, it also has triggered a proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. When the notion of you having nuclear weapons is enough for the world’s super power to invade, why wouldn’t you hurry up and create a nuclear warhead to defend yourself?</p>
<p class="break">On two more accounts the Bush administration miscalculated the gains of the invasion in terms of regional stability. In the rationale of gaining Iraq to weaken Iran, policymakers clearly oversaw that Iranian influence in the region was inversely related to internal stability of the region. In some respects one could argue that the US handed Iraq to Iran.</p>
<p>In the process of nation building, after the fall of the Saddam regime, an uprising of Sunni’s endangered the US pathway. The Sunni minorities or Iraq were protected and privileged by Saddam Hussein’s Ba’ath party. To suppress the uprising, US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and General David Patraeus authorized the creation of elite Iraqi police militia; those who enlisted were mainly Shi’ites out for vengeance. The US policymakers reinforced sectarianism and thereby triggered a dirty war. In 2005 the NYTimes Magazine dubbed it “The Salvadorization of Iraq”.</p>
<p>In terms of hegemonic power gains the Iraq invasion did not help the US either. Not only did the US loose its grip on the region, by doing so it also lost some of its credibility worldwide. When the fog of war descended on the battlefield, the pretensions of a global empire blurred.</p>
<p>Combined with the interests due, the total war cost is likely to reach over 6 trillion dollars (6.000.000.000.000). The death toll among Americans is 4,487 soldiers and at least 3,400 U.S. contractors such as the infamous Private Military Companies. The death toll among Iraqis is estimated at 176,000 to 189,000, of whom more than 130,000 civilians.</p>
<p>Hundreds of billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives later, there is no denying it that the Iraq war severely damaged the US economy as well as its international credibility.</p>
<p class="break">The unsuccessful history of Iraq explains Obama’s relative restraint in worldwide interventionism today. Moreover, the Iraq war has created a wedge between the Cold War remnant that is NATO. The Atlantic seems ever expanding since 2003, when France and Germany chose to contemplate from the sidelines rather than participate. The U.S. even called for a boycott of French imports.</p>
<p>It is clear that NATO no longer possesses a big stick, it’s heydays are long gone as most members are unwilling or only capable of symbolic participation. The Iraq War restored the rightful role of the UN Security Council in international politics. Although this intergovernmental institution is imperfect, it is the only legitimate way of handling world problems.</p>
<p class="break"><strong>Russian realism.</strong></p>
<p>In the summer of 2006, George W. Bush met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a news conference at a G8 conference. In their conversation Mr. Bush drew attention to the challenges posed by democratic freedoms, and then noted that things had gotten much better in Iraq. Putin immediately responded that he would rather not want democracy the Iraqi way.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war Russian rhetoric was mild, as Putin feared to jeopardize the ties to the U.S.. Moscow’s rhetoric toughened in February 2003, after Paris and Berlin convinced president Putin to act more decisively. For the first time, Russia did not oppose the Western bloc, on the contrary it joined it against the others.</p>
<p>In Kremlin’s eyes the 2003 invasion of Iraq – launched when the 2001 war in Afghanistan was far from over – reaffirmed its assessment that Western policy is irrational and guided by non-calculated emotions.</p>
<p>The hegemonic state and its adherents do what they want, while they fail to rationalize what they do. The sustainable world order that emerged through the efforts of Mikhail Gorbachev was in danger. Regional and global stability are at risk due to the imperial overstretch of the last remaining Cold War superstate.</p>
<p class="break"><strong>Domestic Political Economy</strong></p>
<p>The situation in Iraq has indeed changed, and in some aspects even for the better. The country has known formally free elections, knows freedom of speech and religion, and its GDP is booming thanks to growing oil exports.</p>
<p>As the ‘coalition of the willing’ has retreated, Iraqis take their faith in their own hands. The transfer of power is however not without issues, old soars such as corruption and sectarianism resurfacing. More than once, current Shi’a Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has been accused of monopolizing power.</p>
<p class="break">The government of al-Maliki is by no means pro-American; Iraqis want to be captain over their own ship and will turn their backs to the allied forces if necessary. Al-Maliki’s government denied American forces judicial immunity against prosecution and is discussing major deals concerning oil, weapons and joint military exercises with Russia, China and even Iran.</p>
<p>The USA is not the eternal ally of Iraq, nor will it monopolize the country’s resources. There is competition on a booming open market. Again the miscalculations made by US policymakers can be stressed.</p>
<p>Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told Congress on March 27, 2003 that Iraqi oil would pay for the reconstruction (and the war):  ”There’s a lot of money to pay for this. It doesn’t have to be U.S. taxpayer money.” Iraq may have reinstated itself as the second largest oil supplier from the Middle East, but even so the revenues of oil do not trickle down to the average Iraqis and as a consequence do not pay for reconstruction.</p>
<p>Ironically, the big winners in Iraq’s oil market are the countries that opposed the war: Russia, China and France. Russia’s second-largest crude oil exporter Lukoil, the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation and the French Total received multi-billion dollar contracts from the Iraqi government in a landmark 2009 auction.</p>
<p class="break"><strong>Conclusion.</strong></p>
<p>By showing no remorse and sticking to a pretend story for the past decade, the U.S. seems to have learned nothing from its misadventure in Iraq. Yes, Mr. Obama is more reluctant when it comes to interventionism and NATO had been discredited, but current attitudes towards missile defense systems and the handling of the situation in Syria only forecast further destabilization of the multilateral world order.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, the Kremlin alerted an impending failure, but the White House turned a deaf ear. “Mission accomplished”?</p>

<p>[tab_item title="Interview"]</p>
<p><em>Inquiring about the position of the Iraqi Kurds a decade after the invasion, Distilled interviewed Renad Mansour, Ph.D candidate at Pembroke College (University of Cambridge) and assistant research director at the Iraq Institute for Strategic Studies. </em></p>
<p class="break">On 19 March 2003, now 10 years ago, the United States and Britain started their war against Iraq and Saddam Hussein. Preceded by massive airstrikes, the first troops already crossed the border of Southern Iraq by the next day. From there on they rushed towards Baghdad, which fell on the 9th of April, allowing President Bush to declare on the 1st of May ‘the end of major combat operations’. As we all know now, this confident declaration only signalled the beginning of the real fight for the coalition troops.</p>
<p>But besides the surge through southern Iraq, another front was opened during the opening period of the war. One week after the start of the invasion, American units were dropped into Northern Iraq where they prevented Iraqi troops from reinforcing the south. In their fight, they met with an often unmentioned ally: the Iraqi Kurds, who had been de facto independent since the 1991 Gulf War. With Turkey refusing to aid the coalition, the Kurds rose to the occasion and captured the important town of Kirkuk one day after the fall of Baghdad. But since then, the fate of these people got buried under the stream of bad news relating to the widespread chaos that ensued following the first months of the war.</p>
<p>Today however, Distilled Extra poses the question about the Kurdish role and position within Iraq. They were involved in the largest war so far fought in the 21st century, and due to their position on the borders with Turkey, Syria, and Iran they remain very much a part of regional high politics. Reason enough for us to speak to Renad Mansour, Ph.D student at Pembroke College, University of Cambridge, and assistant research director at the Iraq Institute for Strategic Studies. As his doctoral research focuses on the question of Iraqi federalism and the Kurdish attempt to draft a separate foreign policy, Mr. Mansour was able to draw a clear picture of their often forgotten influence.</p>
<div class="float">

</div>
<p>Although the Iraqi Kurds were participants from the start, their role was far from predetermined before the beginning of the actual fighting. In early 2003, the international community was radically divided over the American plans for invasion and according to Mansour the Kurds also pondered about the course they should follow. ‘Saddam Hussein was a great antagonist to their national struggle, which came to genocide in the 1980s. So although they had achieved de facto independence under the no-fly zone since 1991, coming up to the war in 2003 the Kurds obviously would rather not have a Saddam in power. But they were also worried. First and foremost they did not want to lose the protectorate they had established in the previous decade, which seemed to be jeopardized by the American plans for a reunified Iraq. They did not want to be put again under some sort of Arab government’.</p>
<p>Although this initial fear even led to some talks with Saddam Hussein, the Kurds ultimately decided to get involved with the Americans as soon as the invasion plans became concrete. ‘Very quickly they became aware of the fact that it would be better for them to take charge of the process, and to direct it to their interests’. And those interests meant that they would follow a strategy of federalism rather than independence. ‘A decentralized Iraq with a weak Baghdad was the objective’, confirms Mansour, ‘and it was this idea of federalism that the Kurdish leaders defended at the pre-war meetings of the Iraqi opposition in London and New York’.</p>
<p>The next big step for the Iraqi Kurds was of course the invasion itself. And here an important factor was the Turkish decision not to support the plans of the Bush administration, which allowed the Kurds to come to the fore. ‘The Turks were not going to be allowed to go into Kurdistan’, says Mansour, ‘meaning that the Americans had to come themselves. What happened next was that when the US troops did go into Iraq, the Kurds were already there, prepared to fight along with them’. This led to joint operations, supported by a very cooperative attitude from the Kurdish leaders. Key example of this was their position regarding Kirkuk, a much disputed city which was returned to an Arab administration as soon as the Americans made the demand.</p>
<p>‘Basically, the strategy at that point was to use their new-found alliance with America as well as the erupted antagonism between the US and Turkey to gain leverage’ states Mansour, ‘ and during this period of rearrangement they strongly benefited from the fact that they were the only group that was decently organized, bringing in experts such as former US diplomat Peter Galbraith and Professor Karel Soltan to lobby on their behalf’.The objective was to get as much as possible out of the political scheme that was soon to be drafted, and much of the results of this tactic can be seen in the 2005 Iraqi constitution. ‘Kurdistan has a lot of autonomy, its own foreign policy and taxation, and the Iraqi army is forbidden to enter the region. They are as autonomous as a region can get’.</p>
<p>But as time progressed, it became also important that Kurdistan managed to survive Iraq’s descent into chaos rather unharmed. ‘It remained a relatively stable region, and keep in mind that since 1991 they were governing their own affairs. There was a group related to Al-Qaeda, Ansar-al-Islam, but regional anti-terrorism units quickly kicked them out’. This stability also came with major advantages, as it allowed the Kurds to use the problems of other parts of the country to their advantage: ‘When the Sunni and the Shia were fighting in Baghdad, the Kurds were ready to be kingmakers’.</p>
<p>To some extent however, these successes backfired after 2010. ‘The Arabs in the country simply saw it as too much. If you look at oil for example, which is a national resource according to the constitution, the Kurds have invited international companies such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, Gazprom and Total to exploit their own regional oilfields. Even though Baghdad has explained to these companies that this is illegal’. Such actions led to a reaction from the Arabs of Iraq as a whole, which was nevertheless not directed against federalism as such, but much more against the fact that if it were allowed to progress too far in favour of any actor it threatened the very cohesion of the country.</p>
<p>And yet, Kurds and Arabs have found themselves together in a different struggle. ‘The big issue in Iraq now is the rise of a new despotic power in Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki. Interestingly enough, this has brought together a cross-ethnic alliance organised by influential Sunni, Shia, and Kurdish leaders to go against him’. And according to Mansour, the Kurds for their part are mainly involved in this because they do not wish to see a new threat arise against their autonomy: ‘They do not want Iraq to have a strong leader’.</p>
<p>Added to the issue of Baghdad centralism is the Kurdish dependency on federal money, with 90% of the resources of the Kurdish Regional Government coming from the capital. ‘This has prompted them to find alternative economic arrangements, one of which is the idea of a pipeline from Turkey through Kurdistan’. So all in all, it seems that after a very advantageous period Kurdistan is increasingly involved in a game of careful balancing between the different forces in the country.</p>
<p>Moving to another field, there is the observation that the Iraqi Kurds are connected to more issues than the national ones. Coupled to their national engagement is the fact that they are playing a proactive role in international politics, and Mansour believes they do so much more than before. ‘In the 1990s they were entirely dependent on the US and the UN as an external guarantor. At least security-wise they can handle their own territory now, and this has allowed them to be more involved in Baghdad politics’. But still, American protection is very much welcome, which has led them to offer the US a permanent base near the Iranian border, although this idea was contested within Kurdistan itself.</p>
<p>The general attitude towards the Iranians seems indeed very hard to describe, as it is fuelled by the antagonism between Tehran and Ankara: ‘There are different segments within Iraqi Kurdistan that have different relations with their eastern neighbour. Iran is a trading partner and some Kurdish Islamist parties have close connections with the country, but other groups are more closely related to Turkey. As a whole, Iraq is becoming a country where these two countries have some sort of a middle-eastern Cold War, and you can observe this as well in Kurdistan’.</p>
<p>Regarding their western frontier and the Syrian civil war, Mansour stresses that there are many foreign policies in Iraq and that the Kurds are only one of the groups that have tried to formulate one of their own. Important for them however is that they have to consider their relatives across the Syrian border, which have been granted a lot more autonomy as Bashar al-Assad wanted to retaliate against Turkish critiques. ‘The consequence was that both Turkey and the Iraqi Kurds now work together to reformat the political program of the Syrian Kurds to one of nonviolence, including a renouncement of PKK strategies. And as long as they do that they will be fine’.</p>
<p>But of course, it is impossible to predict how the situation will evolve for the Iraqi Kurds. It are uncertain times for everyone involved in Iraq and pessimism prevails in European and North-American media. But according to Mansour, there are signs of hope: ‘The picture of Iraq right now is very grim, and is hard to see, at least in the near future, some shift towards democratic governance. But that is not to say it is a complete disaster, and when you talk to many Iraqis they know that the system is corrupt but there is also some optimism, much more than in the West. And they have to be optimistic: not for nothing Iraq has a history of cross-ethnic relations’.</p>
