<p>This Wednesday there were <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/centrist-coalition-looks-likely-after-dutch-election">advanced elections in the Netherlands</a>. And whatever your location on our big floating rock, you should care.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because of the Eurocrisis? Not really, the Netherlands were never <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/21560879">as critical as Finland</a>, nor <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/21562981">as crucial as Germany</a>. Then surely because <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/dutch-election-radicals-idINL5E8KDB2020120913" target="_blank">the huge defeat of Geert Wilders' PVV</a>. If not for Europe, isn't this a victory for human civilization as a whole? Well no. Pleasing as his downfall may be, on a global scale it isn't all that significant. The world hasn't run out of his type of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/all" target="_blank">classless, vomit-inducing crackpots</a> just yet. <a href="http://www.distilledmagazine.com/blog/?p=392" target="_blank">Unfortunately</a>.</p>
<p>Or maybe because <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/dutch-elections-battle-stoner-vote" target="_blank">the victorious VVD party wants to ban the sale of weed to foreigners</a>? On that you can judge for yourself, Dear Reader. It's not what I wanted to talk about.</p>

<p>No, way more significant is what's happening as we speak, and will probably go on for a few more weeks. I'm talking about the complicated process of forming a multi-party coalition government. In the Netherlands they call this <em>polderen</em>, a verb that <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Polder#Polders_and_the_Netherlands">literally means reclaiming land from the sea</a> by means of dykes and complex water works, but now refers mainly to the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Polder_Model">Dutch political culture of consensus-seeking</a>.</p>
<p>The title of this article has officially introduced this verb into the English language (to polder, regular conjugation), use it wisely.</p>
<p>And use it you should. Because in reality all polities polder, just not in the public eye. In the Netherlands this is a fairly transparant process, where official parties with official programmes try to cement a consensus in an official coalition agreement. In other countries this translation of ideology into policies is more opaque. In Britain, the main ideological clashes tend to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/nadine-dorries-kill-david-cameron_n_1873473.html">materialise as internal party struggles</a>. In the United States the hollow ideological debates are separated from the actual policies by a complicated cloud of checks, balances, and filibuster. And lobbyists. <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/watch?v=EMMppBhOLXA" target="_blank">Lots.</a> <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/watch?v=9LCUEKvapxk" target="_blank">Of.</a> <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/watch?v=wQUloIsrEEE" target="_blank">Lobbyists.</a> As for China, there no one really knows who does the poldering right now, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/world/asia/xi-jinping-chinas-presumptive-new-leader-mysteriously-absent.html" target="_blank">or who will do it in the future</a>. And finally, the European Union... On second thought, let's not bother with the EU. The human brain can only cope with so much opacity.</p>
<p>So this is why you should be interested in the endless bickering between the Dutch right-wing liberals (41  MPs) and Wilders' far-right nutters (15), between the social-democrats (38) and the far-left socialists (15), between the left-liberals (12) and the Christian Democrats (13), between the nutty Christian conservatives (5) and the even-more-nutty Christian conservatives (3), between the Greens (3) and the animal rights party (2), and between all of the above and the old people's party (2).*</p>
<p>You should be interested in these debates just because they are public. In your country they're probably going on as well. It's just that they're taken out of sight by — to use a phrase of the famous Dutch novelist Harry Mulish — <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/the-golden-wall" target="_blank">the Golden Wall</a>.</p>
<p>*Yes, all of these parties are in the Dutch parliament. For real.</p>
