<p style="text-align: justify;">Kids use them to chase a cat through backyards, soldiers use them in Afghanistan to neutralise insurgents from a distance. I am talking about drones, probably the most game changing technology in warfare since the jet engine. Drones or UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are remote controlled aircrafts without human life on board. Drones have changed the way the US and the rest of the world spies and fights, but for the better or the worse?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MQ-9_Reaper_in_flight_2007.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3809" alt="MQ-9_Reaper_in_flight_(2007)" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MQ-9_Reaper_in_flight_2007-300x214.jpg" width="300" height="214" /></a>The US army uses drones since the NATO Operation “Allied Force” in Yugoslavia in 1999, at that time nobody knew about their existence. Over the years the importance of the drone in US warfare has steadily grown. Today the US airforce’s fleet consists of over 1/3 of drones, around 7500 of them. The US army has a drone base in Saudi-Arabia and plans the construction of a base in Nigeria. Major turning points in the US drone policy were the launch of the ‘War on Terror’ in 2001 and the appointment of Mr. Barack Obama as US president in 2008. Since the Nobel Peace Prize winner entered the White House overt drone attacks have increased sevenfold.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As their numbers reach an all time high, nobody will doubt that drones are the US’ new weapon of choice in the “War on Terror”. In 2011 the US army conducted 294 drone attacks in Afghanistan and many more elsewhere, thereby checking off many of the names on the notorious ‘Kill List’ for enemies of the United States.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The unmanned vehicles have proven to be most effective targetted killing machines and information gatherers so far, thereby creating a frenzy fueled also by the fact that no American citizens are at risk of losing their life in the line of duty. Drones can go anywhere and strike almost instantaneously, giving the US a “Big Brother” omnipresence at relatively low political and financial cost. The significant minimization of risk that the drone technology creates will be the main drive for changes in warfare in the years to come. Risky operations that would never have been conducted with conventional airplanes are now within reach.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is however a dark side to this military fairytale. There are many questions to be answered concerning the legality and morality of the use of drones, all ignored or downplayed by the industry and government officials. The debate on drone usage has mainly been an acedemic one, yet since the nomination of John Brennan as new head of the CIA the debate has reached a broader public. Mr. Brennan, a former secret agent, was Obama’s head of counter-terrorism. He is said to be the architect of the drone policy, the ‘Kill List’ and the “War on Terror” in general.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main problem with drones is the tension between presence and absence. The drone is there, spying or attacking, yet the enemy is not – or is he?<i></i> A drone has a sense of unattainability and irresponsibility to it, it is a technology that is both beyond our conceptualisation of things and beyond the reach of today’s international laws. Drones create a vacuum of injustice. The US could be badly mistaken if it thinks that using drones is the best way to get involved and all the while ‘not get involved’ in a conflict.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The absence/precense tension is even more prominent in covert CIA operations. Since the start of the “War on Terror” the Central Intelligence Agency increases its militarisation. Violence rather than intelligence have become the trademark business of the US secret service. Lack of moral and legal use is even bigger in the domain of CIA-led drone operations, most of them conducted in countries with which the US is not at war. According to the Bureau of investigative Journalism, CIA covert operations have claimed 2629 to 3461 lives in Pakistan since 2004, many of whom innocent civilians.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Drones are a radically new technology that changes the way the US thinks about war, and soon the rest of the world will follow. Sadly though, the technology is evolving faster than policymakers’ knowledge of how to morally and legally make use of it. Drones are a provocative symbol of US domination, their use today further decays the legitimacy of the US’ “War on Terror” and the credibility of Obama as a Nobel peace Prize winner.</p>
