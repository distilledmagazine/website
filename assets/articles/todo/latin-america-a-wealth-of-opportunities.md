<p style="text-align: justify;">Latin America, beset in the past by debt defaults, currency devaluations and the need for bailouts from the World Bank and IMF, has ushered in a new era of growth, stability and investment which has transformed the region’s economic landscape, a similar process to what the Asian Tiger economies achieved in the 1980s.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/southam1.png"><img class="alignleft" title="southam" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/southam-246x3001.png" width="246" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Robust economic growth since the mid-2000s combined with low levels of government debt has placed many Latin American countries in good standing to attract foreign direct investment. These developments have created the necessary environment for transforming the economy and state, through the adoption of ambitious public policies that lock in the prospect of long-term development and mitigate short-term risks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The continent’s economic growth has led to rising exports, reflecting a deepening engagement with Asia, where demand from China and other countries for commodities such as copper, iron ore, tin and gold, combined with sound economic policies across numerous Latin American countries are helping to control deficits and keep inflation low. Continued economic growth will largely be dependent on strong international demand for South American commodities, which are set to remain high, for the foreseeable future. Brazil, for example is the world’s largest exporter of ethanol fuel, a commodity that is expected to increase in demand from the sustainable energy sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Economic growth within the region has demanded a sustainable banking sector to provide credit for investors and additional capital. The regions banking sector has fared well with 9 of the 14 countries scoring 5 points or higher on Euromoney’s country risk survey. This can be attributed to strong regulation, particularly in the region’s most developed countries, which have focused on ensuring the baking sectors stability and resiliency. The lessons learnt from the region’s economic mismanagement of the 1980s and 1990s proved to be a turning point in ensuring much improved regulation and fiscal management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly, the regions banking sector has benefited from the strong economic performance, leading to lower interest rates, which have contributed to much needed lower costs of borrowing, resulting in higher investment activity. Strong growth projections have also prompted banks to ease restrictive lending policies, which in turn enables business and households to boost spending. Preventing a build-up of potential vulnerabilities should be the main focus of prudential policies, especially as capital flows may intensify from increased economic growth and investment, raising the risk of credit and asset price bubbles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Venezuela, and to a lesser extent Argentina, seem to be exceptions to a broader trend as they continue to lag behind their neighbours in achieving successful economic growth. Venezuela’s President, has pursued an isolationist and ‘anti-market’ stance in hisgovernment policies, leading to the nationalisation of many of the countries chief export industries, with only one state owned oil company in charge of production. Such policies have of course deterred investments as returns will be set to remain negligible. Argentina’s ability to recover from its sovereign default in 2001 and attract foreign investment remains in the balance due to poor restructuring of the economy. This can be attributed by an inability to boost money supply growth, leading to inflation and currency devaluation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall though, positive economic trends in much of Latin America bear well for the growth prospects of the region. Strong demand for exports and sustainable economic policies, combined with evolving financial institutions have lowered debt levels and will continue to attract inward investment from multinationals and financial institutions. These factors have provided the region, particularly the stronger performing nations (Chile, Brazil and Columbia) with low-medium sovereign risk. However, the reliance on China as a trade partner does makes the region more exposed to a potential growth slowdown in China, which would affect the region through lower export demand and commodity prices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately continued economic growth hinges on the ability of the regions institutions to absorb global economic shocks – judging from its performance during the Eurozone financial crisis the region is well placed to maintain its continuing growth trajectory within the global economy.</p>
