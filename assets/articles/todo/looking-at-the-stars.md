<p>Even in the blogosphere, sometimes the topic picks you.</p>

<p>Where were you when you heard about Neil Armstrong's death?</p>
<p>I don't think I'm the only one to answer this question with  "on Twitter". Actually, when trying to check the fact in the traditional media, none of my bookmarked news sites reported it for what seemed like an online decade. Eventually I did find the confirmation... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neil_Armstrong&amp;oldid=509126876">on Wikipedia</a>. But something tells me Neil Armstrong would have liked it this way — technology triumphing over tradition. The "white-socks, pocket-protector, nerdy engineer" in him might well have been pleased. This however I know from the excellent Economist obituary — that's traditional media pulling one back to equalize (<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/obituary" target="_blank">do read it</a>).</p>
<p>Finished? Okay, then you learned Armstrong didn't really like to be called a hero. That shouldn't stop us from silently <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/watch?v=QRP6AyvNuV0" target="_blank">acknowleding the heroics of his mission</a>, but in a way though, he was right.</p>
<p>He was merely the figurehead of  a truly massive project. A project that only realised its big achievements thanks to a team of the finest thinkers and technicians around, backed by an enormous amount of public resources. But however big the achievements, they were only limited to a few fields. Prestige obviously, but also science and exploration. What they didn't achieve was commercial viability, and that would prove to be the Achilles heel. After the first few travels, the funding was withdrawn and the project faded.</p>
<p>See what I did there? By keeping things vague and filtering out the hard facts, I made the last paragraph equally applicable to another historical figure: the Chinese admiral <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Zheng_he" target="_blank">Zheng He</a>. Like Neil Armstrong, he was the figurehead of a set of high-tech, prestige-enhancing expeditions, funded by the age's superpower. Not in outer space of course — in the Indian Ocean. Like NASA, Zheng's fleet didn't create enough lucrative offshoots that warranted the massive public spending. Both projects were the first things to be cut from the books in the next round of spending cuts. For China, the long-term failure of their naval expeditions spelled the beginning of the end for their superpower status, leaving the rule of the waves to Spain, Portugal, the Dutch Republic, and eventually Britain. They pretty much missed the chance to maintain their world power status going into the modern age.</p>
<p>So does the decline of NASA predict the decline of the U.S.? Was Neil Armstrong the last of a dying breed? Well, no. First and foremost, Buzz Aldrin is still alive, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/watch?v=dsK4ZOVQonc" target="_blank">kicking the living hell out of any conspiracy theorist doubting his achievements</a>.</p>
<p>But, more importantly, the race for space has resumed, and as <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/neil-armstrong-new-space-race" target="_blank">this Guardian piece</a> shows — that's 2-1 for traditional media, by the way — the Americans are still very much in it. True, there are some new competitors, but these Chinese and Indian projects appear to be very similar to the big-spending publicity stunts of NASA.  The U.S. on the other hand have chosen the private option. Instead of national pride, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/What-The-Future-Of-Space-Travel-Means-For-Consumers.aspx" target="_blank">America's new pioneers are looking for profits</a>. Starting to sound more like Columbus than Zheng He, doesn't it?</p>
<p>But whoever takes the first step — be it China, the U.S., or someone else — <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/watch?v=oY59wZdCDo0" target="_blank">it is vital that mankind makes this leap</a>, however <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/watch?v=p-6mnzyIhaE&amp;t=2m0s" target="_blank">costly on the short term</a>. There's really only one thing worse than going to the stars, and that's merely looking at them.</p>
