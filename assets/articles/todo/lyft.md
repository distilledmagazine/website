<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I recently moved to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Berkeley,_California" target="_blank">Berkeley</a> California,  in the San Francisco Bay Area. <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Street_people" target="_blank">Berkeley has a lot of character</a>, which is another way of saying that it’s a bit weird and kind of shaggy. Bums and hippies infest the various nooks and crannies of town, and students from UC Berkeley invade the local ice cream shops every night (leaving the bars strangely empty and forlorn).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">But perhaps the strangest sight I’ve seen so far have been cars of every shape and size with large fuzzy pink mustaches adorning their metallic noses. I soon found out that these are cars in the employ of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lyft" target="_blank">Lyft</a>, a private rideshare service startup that owes its origins to nearby Silicon Valley.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">What is Lyft? It’s a service where you can call upon your fellow residents of the Bay Area to give you a ride to your destination via an easy-to-use app on your mobile device of choice. Simply put, Lyft is a taxicab service where your taxi driver is some schmuck with a smartphone and a pink mustache.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Oh, did I forget to mention that Lyft is destroying America? Yeah, Lyft is a symptom of a horrific disease that metastasized out of Santa Clara Valley and is now infesting this country and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">There have been reports of how <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/is-this-ridesharing-app-literally-causing-an-sf-class-b-759489742" target="_blank">resentment has been brewing between Lyft drivers and established taxi cab drivers</a> in San Francisco.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/9326085816_5249fabd8f_o.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7266 alignleft" alt="Photo Courtesy of Lucas Shaffer http://flic.kr/p/fd7Cp3 lyft, car, ride sharing, app, mobile, taxi, cab, san francisco, " src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/9326085816_5249fabd8f_o.jpg" width="267" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">People in addition to being worried about the safety of Lyft (ie. getting a lift from total unlicensed strangers), are concerned with how the expense of the service would exclude those who would otherwise need to ride public transit. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-07-02/uber-to-lyft-win-as-bart-rail-strike-strands-bay-area-commuters" target="_blank">Tensions rose recently between workers and the tech elite during a BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) strike </a>precisely because a significant portion of their normal user base opted for private rideshare services, leaving fewer and fewer people using BART and invested in the labor struggle of its workers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">There is a problem with services like Lyft. Society relies on a significant level of mutual trust and cooperation in order to run smoothly. Even basic market transactions requires us to believe that we won’t constantly be deceived and manipulated; that what we are receiving in exchange for our money is something of real value. Most importantly, society requires its participants to believe that everyone plays by the same rules, and that there is a consequence for breaking those rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Lyft and its ilk further segment society into different socioeconomic classes with their own rules, and over time this erodes trust and cooperation between these classes as well as a belief in a common public good. Usually this erosion leaves the poor and middle class holding the bag while the rich take off into their gated communities (in business, transportation, education, etc.). While this erosion is tolerated for a while, frustration will inevitably build leading to outbursts and violent altercations between different groups of society. Given that most Lyft drivers are likely to be people who need the money from being a part-time cabbie rather than people who just enjoy giving their fellow citizens a lift, we are bound to see some sort of resentment curdle with time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">A strong sense of community is essential to adapting to problems that require collective action (which are quite frequent in cities). We need to retain some sense that we are the same people seeking to solve the same shared problems. When there are super poor and super rich parts of the Bay Area, connected only by Google buses with tinted windows, competing against each other for space, there can only be turmoil. That is why a conservative approach to the problem of how to get people from one part of the metro region to the other ought not to focus on further deregulation (that allows companies like Lyft to exist), but a greater development of communal institutions like BART that bring all strata of Bay Area society together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Lyft is a service that takes advantage of people’s vulnerability in a time of economic downturn to treat them as means – to get from point A to B – and not ends. No amount of techno-utopianism can ever conceal that unvarnished fact.</p>
