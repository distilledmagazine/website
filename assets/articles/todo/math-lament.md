<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">While wandering through the math and statistics library this week, I came across probably the best description of the modern economics curriculum that I have seen.  If a math and statistics library seems like a strange place to find a description of economics, then you probably have not spent much time enjoying advanced economics courses recently.  I could think of no more appropriate forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In fact, the book that I happened upon was indeed not about economics at all, but rather <em><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/6232657-a-mathematician-s-lament" target="_blank">A Mathematician’s Lament</a>,</em> a book that bemoans the formulaic and mind-numbing treatment of mathematics in K-12 U.S. education. As much a diatribe as a lament, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pastinthepresent.com" target="_blank">Paul Lockhart</a> delivers an impassioned plea to put math into its historical and imaginative context.  Rather than a dry, structured march towards an opaque goal, math education should engage the student’s natural problem-solving imagination.  Lockhart argues that math is a journey and an art form that should not be obscured by language and formal curriculum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">“This is why it is so heartbreaking to see what is being done to mathematics in school.  This rich and fascinating adventure of the imagination has been reduced to a sterile set of facts to be memorized and procedures to be followed.” (27)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">For anyone who had an early life fascination with math stamped out by monotonous proofs and formalism, this manifesto will reawaken the soul.  Beyond a painfully accurate critique, Lockhart, a talented math professor who left the ivory tower to try his hand at inspiring young minds in a Brooklyn high school, delights readers with the beauty of math.  Part One’s “Lamentation,” represented by Albrecht Dürer’s incomparable Melancholia I on the cover, is followed by Part Two’s “Exultation.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">After several years of economics study, the dichotomy of lamentation and exultation was all too familiar.  It seems that math and economics have more in common than their underlying mathematical methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">“Why aren’t we giving our students a chance to even hear about these things, let alone giving them an opportunity to actually do some mathematics, and to come up with their own ideas, opinions, and reactions?  What other subject is routinely taught without any mention of its history, philosophy, thematic development, aesthetic criteria, and current status?  What other subject shuns its primary sources—beautiful works of art by some of the most creative minds in history—in favor of third-rate textbook bastardizations?” (40)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, an obvious example is economics, taught almost exclusively out of textbooks and without mention of the intellectual giants that shaped the field.  Beyond cursory mentions of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and John Maynard Keynes in throwaway lines introducing their most famous models, the economics curriculum is mostly devoid of historical context.  As many popular books have shown, the history of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/How_Markets_Fail.html?id=7Nji8Xl6KuYC" target="_blank">economics weaves an intriguing narrative</a>.  Nonetheless, from the ethical roots in Hume, Smith, and Mill to the revolutions of Jevons, Menger, and Walras and of Marx through the tug-of-war between Fisher, Keynes, and Friedman, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/The_worldly_philosophers.html?id=N_3cj4urgJcC" target="_blank">the history of economics is as rich as it is ignored</a>.  The stories that could illuminate historical choices and future alternatives are left in most programs in favor of dutiful pursuit of the most rigorous calculations possible, a process with its own inherent costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">“The effect of such a production being made over something so simple is to make people doubt their own intuition.  Calling into question the obvious by insisting that it be 'rigorously proved' . . . is to say to a student 'Your feelings and ideas are suspect. You need to think and speak our way.'” (72)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">It stifles the art and philosophy that underlies every theory in economics.  These theories are born out of the human struggle to understand the human struggle.  Models, assumptions, and even goals are created through a process of history every time monetary policy is mentioned without mentioning the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Long_Depression" target="_blank">Long Depression</a> and populism of the late 19th century.  Without context, economics is a punch-line without a joke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Lockhart drives home the point that formalism is intellectual obstructionism.  Rigorously working through details is not and never has been the path to intuitive understanding.  “Painful and creatively frustrating as it may be, students and their teachers should at all times be engaged in the process—having ideas, not having ideas, discovering patterns, making conjectures, constructing examples and counterexamples, devising arguments, and critiquing each other’s work.” (61)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This book is many things.  It is a critique, an analogy, and a plea.  However, beyond those technical qualities, <em>A Mathematician’s Lament</em> reawakens the feeling of elation and aesthetic perfection when an idea spontaneously becomes understanding.  It puts math, and I would argue economics in extension, in context as beautiful worlds of human inspiration.</p>
