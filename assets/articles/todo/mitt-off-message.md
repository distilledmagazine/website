<p><em>We are pleased to present the first post in our new political cartoons series by Washington, DC metro-based political cartoonist Jeff D'Onofrio.</em></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_453" align="alignnone" width="2108"]<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/mitt-off-message-9.14.121.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-453" title="mitt off message 9.14.12" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/mitt-off-message-9.14.121.jpg" width="2108" height="1600" /></a> The Romney campaign cannot close the growing polling gap with the President by chasing every news cycle and throwing everything out there to see what sticks. Jobs and the economy are the only issues in which more likely voters trust him over Obama. When Mitt tries to throw the deep ball to catch-up on issues like foreign policy and entitlements, he is losing on the White House's turf.[/caption]</p>
