<p>The last few months have seen a real upsurge of royal activity in North-western Europe. It all started at the end of April when <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Queen_Beatrix">Queen Beatrix</a>, Princess of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau, Princess of Lippe-Biesterfeld, etc., etc., etc., abdicated in favour of her son <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Willem-Alexander_of_the_Netherlands">Willem-Alexander</a>, Prince of Orange-Nassau, Junker of Amsberg, etc., etc., etc.. This weekend the Dutch decision was followed by <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Albert_II_of_Belgium">Albert II</a>, King of the Belgians, Prince of Liège, Prince of Belgium, who vacated the throne of the tiny European country and was replaced by his son <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Philippe_of_Belgium">Philippe</a>, Duke of Brabant, Prince of Belgium. Finally, the United Kingdom had its own royal highlight on Monday, as Catherine Middleton, Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge, brought a perfectly timed Prince of Cambridge into this world.</p>
<p>As this (not even exhaustive) list of titles suggest, the world of royals is a strange one, and as our own Brecht Savelkoul argues one that might easily be <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/ridicule-royalty/">ridiculed</a>. They carry more names and denominators than can be imagined, with most of them having no real meaning whatsoever. It is the fifth time a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Duke_of_Cambridge">Duke of Cambridge</a> is created out of thin air, and the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Duke_of_Brabant">Duke of Brabant </a>might as well have been called Lord of Winterfell; both carry the same amount of power in contemporary politics. When it comes to adhering to fictitious names, the royal houses of Europe can hold their own against George R.R. Martin or J.R.R. Tolkien.
<p class="break">It is therefore no surprise that many are annoyed by these bygone powerhouses. On social media, one popular question was why we should pay so much attention to one specific <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/royal-baby-spoof_n_3634135.html?utm_hp_ref=mostpopular">new-born</a> child, whereas millions are born every day. Except in the Netherlands, where being Orange-crazy is almost a requirement for full citizenship, these feelings often merge with the ideas of republican activists. In their opinion, the only good monarchy is an abolished monarchy, or at least one with a mere symbolic function. The royal branches of Europe should be transferred to the political sidelines, and left to disappear in their world of self-created dignities.
<p>The republicans usually have three reasons for this. One, a hereditary position of power has no place in our modern democracies. Everybody should be able to reach the pinnacle of power in his or her society. Two, Royals do nothing more than ‘acting noble’. What is the point of using tax money to pay the salaries of people who do not have real jobs? Third, and even worse, monarchies indeed cost a lot. Why should we spend so much money on families we never elected and who do nothing? Monarchies are undemocratic, lazy, and costly. These are strong arguments, especially as they pit monarchies against the modern values of democracy, meritocracy, and economic efficiency. Or, as Brecht Savelkoul phrased it to make his case for more ridicule, they are ‘outdated and illiberal’.

<p>So, should we topple Europe’s Kings and Queens? Perhaps. But not necessarily because of the above three reasons. In fact, the republican argument is not entirely fair in each of its main ideas.
<p>Is Belgium undemocratic because it has a King? Definitely not. My vote determines political course of action, and at any point I can vote for someone who wants to see the King removed from office. There is nothing the monarchy can do besides what they are explicitly and democratically allowed to. And given the fact that the current Belgian <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Elio_Di_Rupo">Prime Minister</a>, who holds the real executive power, is gay and stems from an Italian immigrant family, there is no reason to believe the roads to power are reserved for traditionalists.
<p>But still, they do not have a real function, do they? This seems correct, but only from a certain angle. As is proven by the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/world-europe-22353398">widespread festivities</a> for the Dutch royal family, the monarchy provides a measure of unity to our modern but fractured nations. Despite the fact that many of the royal traditions are invented or even reinvented, they still form a glue between the members of their society and create a link with the (imaginary) memory of the country. This is in particular the case for Belgium, where the monarchy is one of the last remaining things Flemish and Walloon people still share. In this respect it is no surprise that the most vigorous republican parties are also those that want to split the country: the monarchy is not a problem because it is a monarchy, but because it is a Belgian monarchy.
<p>Additionally, royals clearly have become a source of entertainment: much like a football game, there is nothing important going on but it can be fun to watch. This undermines the argument that monarchies are prime examples of inefficient spending, which should be abolished in times of crisis. Because sports and royals nowadays largely share the task of creating a feeling of unity whilst being entertaining, we might compare the spending on both. The best European football clubs in 2010 had individual <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/50035">debts</a> up to £718 million, and the most recent <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/london-2012-olympics-cost-total">Olympics</a> cost somewhere around £9 billion. As a contrast, the British republicans estimate that the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom">monarchy</a> yearly requires between 130 and 180 million Pounds. This means that Queen Elisabeth II and her successors only surpass the cost of this one sport event after about fifty years of performing the exact same task.
<p class="break">With this, the arguments that monarchies are inherently undemocratic, non-functional and economically irrational are debunked. Does this mean our royals should stick around? As said, not necessarily. The <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/1367920720_841568.html">scandals</a> of the Spanish monarchy demonstrate that there is no need for more corrupt, fraudulent, and aloof institutions in Europe. But if royalty succeeds in adapting to the 21st century, then why should Europeans throw away something that can be unique, unifying and entertaining?<br />
