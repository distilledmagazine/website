<p style="text-align: justify;">The Renaissance finished off Latin as a living language. At least that is what some people like to argue. As early humanists started idealising Classical Latin over their own Medieval variant, they basically threw away a full millenium of spontaneous linguistic evolution. Authenticity became the new originality. And old originality the new vulgarity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our postmodern generation — yes, you can take that as an insult — has done something similar to classical music. Beethoven is dead. And we have killed him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And by that I mean his music. The man himself had already joined the choir invisible in 1827, but up until the 1970s his music was still very much alive. It was still played as if it were fresh and contemporary. Inspired conductors from Furtlwangler to Carlos Kleiber creatively interpreted his scores rather than merely reproducing them. A 150-year performance tradition coloured every rendition as much as the original text itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This started to change in the early 1980s. A new group of ensembles wanted to return to the authentic Beethoven, following the example of Sir Roger Norrington. Norrington himself recounts the evolution in <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/beethoven">this 2009 Guardian piece</a>: the conductor's individual expression and originality had to take the backseat. Recreating the pieces as they should have sounded in the early 1800s became the new goal (much like recreating Ancient Latin was the ultimate achievement for an early humanist). Enter authentic 1800 tempi, authentic 1800 playing techniques, and most strikingly,  authentic 1800 instruments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whereas Norrington's first attempts at the Beethoven symphonies still sound like works-in-progress most of the time, the next twenty years saw a whole range of other ensembles giving it a try. So large is the choice now that, for every symphony, I have found a "historically correct" personal favourite that I actually prefer over any traditional philharmonic rendition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of them? No. One big piece stood in the way. Until a about week ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Until last week, there was only one piece I hadn't found a satisfactory period recording for: the Ninth. But then I stumbled across this excellent though unknown rendition by the American Bach Soloists. Released in 2007, it got very minimal attention from mainstream media; it is nigh impossible to find a proper review elsewhere. So let us distill it for you.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The basic question you're probably asking yourselves is: "Why would I throw out my old version of the Ninth for this one?" First of all, because the odds are you probably have the same old Karajan one. But even if that's not the case, there are reasons enough why you might like this one better than whatever version you've got at the moment. The clarity of non-vibrato strings in the beginning of the opening movement. The aggressive natural trumpets in the Scherzo. The fragility of authentic wooden flutes in the Adagio. "Of course," you will scream, "This is it! The REAL Beethoven!" And the <em>Ode to Joy</em> hasn't even started yet...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But once the last <em>Götterfunken </em>have died out, once the final exotic sounds have left the time-machine-instruments, you'll realize the past has become a truly foreign country. And you have definitively banished poor old Ludwig to this wasteland. By trying to retrieve him, we killed Beethoven. Like Orpheus' fateful last glance at Eurydice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I've found only one real consolation so far. "Science advances one funeral at a time," Max Planck once said. The same probably holds true for the arts. I hope.</p>
