<p dir="ltr">Last May <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Navi_Pillay" target="_blank">Navi Pillay</a> visited the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Katholieke_Universiteit_Leuven" target="_blank">University of Leuven </a>to speak to Belgian Law students. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights chose as her topic a rather challenging problem: how will we protect the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rule_of_law" target="_blank">Rule of Law</a> on the internet?</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pillay grew up in Apartheid South Africa, and for her talk she argued from this perspective. She considers herself an expert on the topic of political tension, popular protest and social change. However, in the field of online technology she considers herself a ‘digital immigrant’. Whereas the youth today has two nationalities, that of their country and that they adapt online, she still needs to find her way in this new environment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The internet has immensely advanced free speech and given people the chance to have their voice heard. For the Commissioner, the online world has ‘obliterated the possibility of governments to monopolize information’. But it does not end there for her: ‘all states have a duty to facilitate access to the internet, including content they do not like’. Here, the classic practice of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/udhr" target="_blank">Human Rights</a> and the internet clearly meet, to the benefit of both.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But Pillay is also worried. Free internet means free speech, but also free crime. What has her particularly worried is the appearance and spreading of hate speech. This of course relates back to her own background, but the commissioner also highlighted what happened with <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hate_radio.html" target="_blank">Radio Mille Collines during the genocide in Rwanda</a>. If traditional means of communication can have such an impact, what could a global hate-call achieve?</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">An additional problem is that the internet on the one hand allows us to expose violations of Human Rights (as happened during the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Arab_Spring" target="_blank">Arab Spring</a>), but on the other increases the capability of  governments to survey their own populations. As the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/nsa-and-prism/" target="_blank">Prism-scandal</a> has shown this is not only a problem of well-known dictatorships or authoritarian regimes. How much freedom will states have in their online conduct and internet law, and what will be the rights of their citizens?</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The best way to protect ourselves from this danger, at least according to Pillay, is to extend the rule of Law to online behavior. The problem with this is that the law must be clear and accessible, but also simple and enforceable. And to achieve this, the digital immigrant reached out to our generation. Her friends and family have fought for their freedom, and want to protect what they have gained. Yet our experience, nowadays almost present from childhood, is required to make this possible. The digital natives need to step up their game, and start thinking about the online world they want to live in.</p>
