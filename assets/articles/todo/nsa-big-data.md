<p>A few weeks ago, many Americans were introduced for the first time to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/the-nsa-files" target="_blank">several NSA programs</a> that monitor the various forms of communication that Americans use every day. Telephone, email, chat, and even Facebook posts. These programs and their extent were revealed by Edward Snowden, a now 30 year old employee of private intelligence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why collect all this data in the first place? Many within the intelligence and security community following 9/11 supposed that the more data we collect on the communications of Americans with foreigners, the easier it would be to predict future terrorist attacks. This approach to data and prediction commonly goes under the title <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Big_data" target="_blank">“Big Data”</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Big Data phenomenon is not just a buzzword unique to the world of intelligence and national security analysis. It has seen applications in various subfields of economics, politics, finance, ecology, and even literary and historical analysis for years. Even the Barack Obama campaign collected massive amounts of data about voters across the country, ranging from where they lived and who they voted for in the past all the way to what their favorite television programs were.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the most prominent examples of big data collection are in the private sector. DVRs, like Tivo, collect information on what we watch and when. Amazon tracks what we look at and spend our money on. Facebook collects information on everything from where we go, who we relate to, what we are interested in, and what we share with others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NSA and its contractors like Booz Allen Hamilton and Palantir, on the other hand, are tracking everything from phone calls, e-mail metadata, Skype chats and calls, and activity on Facebook. The data would supposedly allow the government to track subversive activity and determine whether an attack is currently being planned or about to be executed. Being able to pinpoint when and where an attack may occur sounds great, so what do we have to fear from our reliance on Big Data?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big Data makes us more susceptible to overreaction. We are conditioned to seek out patterns, and in an environment with lots of noise (lots of data), even a faint signal is enough to activate our pattern-recognition senses, even when that signal may not be truly significant in proper context. Having lots of data does not allow us to pick up on when and how our systems fail or collapse. Human systems are inherently complex and nonlinear. Consequently, these systems are chaotic, meaning that even a minor perturbation may grow to be a disruptive event that completely changes the rules and structure of the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, the belief that we can always make predictions better by collecting more data is great for a class of people I call “utopia grifters”. Utopia grifters drift from person to person offering some magical wizardry that solves all your problems without requiring you to think or work hard. It lets those in charge (politicians, corporate executives, etc.) to say that they are completely aware of the current threat landscape without performing a critical analysis. The best part? When something bad happens, they would be impervious to the charge that they were asleep at the wheel. This is precisely what happened following 9/11, when many Americans of nearly all political stripes supported the creation of these large scale data collection programs. Americans didn’t want situation where inadequate monitoring on the part of the government led to another terrorist attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The narrative about these NSA programs has shifted away from these actual surveillance and data collection programs to the trials and tribulations of Edward Snowden. That shift has obscured the most critical question I think these revelations pose: does it even make sense to collect all this data? <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/NSA-Utah.png"><img class="wp-image-5697 alignleft" alt="NSA Utah" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/NSA-Utah.png" width="269" height="202" /></a> Not only do these programs strain the relationship and trust between people and state, but they may not even allow us to predict future attacks and threats. We are collecting so much data these days that we don’t even have the time, computing capacity, or manpower to meaningfully analyze any of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if we did manage to sift through these exobytes of data (currently housed in some storage facility in Utah), national security threats by their very nature are beyond our capacity to adequately model or predict. We would need to possess the mind of God in order to have total information awareness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are many utopians who believe that the future is about collecting data on everything; with enough data we can dissolve the need for theory or any thought at all. Everything we need to know can be derived from regression models fit to the existing data. It’s this belief that everything can be extrapolated that has dominated economic and financial thinking for decades. As a result, many prominent politicians, economists, and financial analysts were caught off guard when their Big Data models were unable to predict our most recent economic crises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big data may seem a great idea for micro-managing our problems when everything stays the same, but it fails when we need help the most: those few critical times when everything changes.</p>
