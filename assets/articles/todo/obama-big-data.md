<p dir="ltr">The Obama campaign ran a breathtaking operation in 2008. They managed to crisscross the country reviving a lofty sense of purpose and vision, embodied in the spirit of one extraordinary man. The election of 2008 was for many the most important election of their lifetime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Flash forward four years, we found that things have changed. The once all-encompassing vision of Obama as a savior to lead us out of our miseries had become one of a leader who often shirked from leading. The economy floundered, and concerns over chronic unemployment and rampant corporate malfeasance were compounded by his seeming lack of leadership and fortitude in the face of the Republican party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In order to win this time around, the Obama campaign had to take a different tactic. Gone were the reasonable, thoughtful speeches and e-mails of the 2008 campaign. In came short casual emails targeted to specific groups of people, the gamification of campaign fundraising and canvassing, with speeches that appealed to certain groups rather than the broader public. In other words, <a href="[http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/when-the-nerds-go-marching-in/265325/" target="_blank">Obama’s campaign began using and abusing “Big Data”</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ever since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Lippmann" target="_blank">Walter Lippman</a> (the father of modern public opinion science and consulting), the holy grail among the political consulting class has been the ability to know more about a specific voter than they know about themselves. With the advent of personal computing technology, the internet, GPS and satellite mapping services, DVRs, RFID, etc., it has become ever easier to collect hyper-specific information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This information is often easily available (at a price) or easily collected, and it can be used to microtarget ads and fundraising appeals to certain fine-grain demographics. The data used by the Obama campaign included typical demographic information used by campaigns for decades (such as age, sex, marital status, ethnicity, income, household size, etc.), but also included data about social networks, previous campaign interactions, and even television viewing habits. This information allowed the Obama campaign to seemingly predict not only how a person would vote, but also how much they would donate, canvass, and make phone calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Obama won his re-election in a particularly toxic economic climate for any incumbent. Like with the hindsight of any victor, it seemed that everything his campaign did, including use of big data, was the key to its victory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nevertheless, Mitt Romney also attempted to collect highly tuned information about voters and lost. He came across looking like a panderer and a charlatan. Obama wasn’t unscathed in this regard. His use of big data made him seem like he stood for nothing, and his e-mails and fundraising appeals were often widely mocked for being <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-11-29/the-science-behind-those-obama-campaign-e-mails" target="_blank">thematically incoherent</a> or <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/nycsouthpaw/the-strange-devolution-obama-campaign-emails-2008" target="_blank">downright strange</a> .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Obama campaign turned into spammers, trying to sell a product instead of building a community and a movement. This technique means that when the election is over, Obama may have won the election but he isn’t guaranteed to have an army of followers willing to do the hard work of making democracy work beyond voting on election day every 4 years. Rather than engage his followers in the long-term projects of nation and movement building, microtargeting has only offered Obama’s voters the short-term gratification of their narrowly-defined self-interests. Even worse, once Obama leaves the political scene, there is no backbench, ideology, or infrastructure to take his place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Microtargeting is how you propel one man or woman to the Presidency, but not how you bring people together. Quite the contrary, microtargeting drives people apart, tempting them to identify by superficial distinctions.</p>
<p>Big data has a lot of promise in the political sphere. Rather than use big data to microtarget people into hyper-specific groups, we ought to be using big data to identify commonalities and points of empathy between different groups of people. Big data could help us tell a story about a movement, one that finds interesting deeply human correlations between the issues one group cares about and the issues of another. Only by building clusters, communities, and relationships with big data can we achieve the political promise of merging organizing with the powerful technology available to us today.</p>
