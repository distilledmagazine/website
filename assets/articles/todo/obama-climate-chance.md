<p>It was four years ago that I spent a week sleeping on the floor of a Washington, DC church. Surprisingly, for me, I chose to be there. I was joining 10,000 other restless youths to demand that President Obama and Congress finally address climate change. Me and my starry eyed college friends had made the 14 hour bus trip all the way from Florida, to speak truth in the halls of power. With an impending crisis on our hands, classes seemed trivial. We needed to do something, and we weren’t alone in that sentiment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although these 10,000 students and youths came from all across the country, we were bound by one mission -- to convince congress and President Obama to finally pass comprehensive climate legislation. The situation was rife with opportunity. With a new President in office who actually acknowledged climate change, and a congress that seemed willing to act, there was a real chance for action. We were leading on the issue within our own generation, and it was time for the US government to do so too. The Conference of Parties climate negotiations in Copenhagen were coming up that year, and there was a real chance for a binding international treaty -- but only if the US took action first to set a good example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope was in the air, and although we had to battle a snowstorm to descend on Capitol Hill, we were undeterred. The United States was finally going to step up and be the leader it always purported to be, and youth were going to be the ones that made it happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast forward four years later. The United States still hasn’t take action on climate, and we don’t have a binding international treaty for CO2 emissions. We are extracting fossil fuels from the earth at increasing rates, all the while becoming increasingly desperate in what we count as a source of fuel. Tar sands being a prime example of this. One of the dirtiest ways to obtain fuel, tar sands literally are oil in a sandy, semi-solid state. Extracting oil from this state creates at least 12% more greenhouse gas emissions than traditional fuels, and results in a Mordoresque landscape where extraction is taking<br />
place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now there is little hope for the United States to take action within the legislature on climate. If congress cannot even pass a simple budget to operate the country, how can they possibly address one of the greatest issues of our time? There is some good news to all of this though. President Obama is able to take concrete action within the executive branch. We do not have to sit by and do nothing. And although the past four years have been disheartening, all is not lost. Great strides have been made at the local and state level. People are fighting with their lives to shut down coal plants, stop hydraulic fracking, and change our energy economy. These people are taking action, and things are changing, with or without the federal government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is time, though, that President Obama sends an international message on where the United States stands on climate. The United States can no longer solely rely on the actions of state and local entities for progress. His recent rhetoric on the subject has been encouraging, but in the end those are just hollow words. President Obama needs to reject the proposed Keystone XL pipeline. This behemoth would carry tar sands oil from Alberta, Canada to Port Arthur, Texas -- destroying the American heartland and becoming a massive source of carbon emissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past year there has been mounting pressure from the environmental and indigenous communities calling on the President to reject the pipeline -- on which he is the final decision maker. Keystone is a real opportunity for President Obama. By rejecting the pipeline, Obama would demonstrate to Americans, and the world, that although congress is utterly incapable of addressing even minor issues, he is in fact willing and capable to govern. It also would show that the United States is finally getting serious about an issue that is long overdue. Let’s hope he makes good on his word.</p>
