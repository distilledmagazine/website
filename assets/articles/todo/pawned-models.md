<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Want to know the limits of economic models? Start up your computer and turn on Chess Titans, the chess simulation game that came standard on Windows computers before Windows 8. Turn the game onto level 1 or 2, and play against the computer. Chances are high that you will win the game if you are familiar with the basics, but don't expect the game to feel genuine.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Most computers these days are intended to simulate a standard game by including a common opening string of moves, but computers set at such a low level must make mistakes. These mistakes will not resemble anything like the mistakes seen in a game with two human opponents. Allow me to give some examples over the past several games I played.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">First, the computer randomly decided to take a pawn defended by another pawn, dropping a piece. Weak players drop pieces all of the time, just as this move simulates, but they do not drop pieces in this way. They leave pieces undefended, they fall for forks that attack multiple pieces at once, and they get distracted by their own ideas and miss attacks that require defense. They do not simply ignore the structure of the game one move by taking a pawn defended by a pawn (as the pawn structure is a pattern that defines every game).</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Second, without any threat or justification, the computer moved his king to the corner in the middle of the game. This in itself is unusual enough, as even the weakest players are usually trying to achieve some goal with all of their moves, even if it is misguided. However, that the computer moved its king back to the original square two moves later went beyond merely unusual. Human opponents may make moves that seem random, but they will never retrace their steps without good reason.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Now, the unusual aspects of computers are also their strengths. Beyond strong computers' obvious advantage in being able to consider thousands of move combinations in an instant, computers have the benefit of considering all possibilities without bias. This makes computers much less prone to manipulation than their human counterparts.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Computers are much more likely to respond to a threat with a simultaneous threat of their own, rather than a passive defense, and this aggressive response makes them much less predictable to an experienced human player. Whereas people are often distracted or intimidated by a threat in a way that precludes them from considering dangerous counterattacks, computers simply look for the strongest responses.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">What does all this mean for economics? Microeconomic systems are contained to one particular individual or market. Like the immediate tactics of a chess game, these markets can be calculated perfectly with assumed rationality and game theory. In other words, a model can calculate what each actor should do to maximize their immediate benefits. However, like chess games, models should have mistakes if they want to be realistic for the average individual actor. Simply throwing in randomly mistaken reasoning will not do; it is analogous to the computer taking the guarded pawn. Like chess games, economic actors make predictable mistakes, a point made clear by behavioral economists such as Dan Ariely, Amos Tversky, and Daniel Kahneman. They follow predictable patterns that are not ideal, but are consistent nonetheless. The anticipated mistakes then affect the actions of other, more rational individuals, like the chess player who anticipates that his opponents will respond defensively to his threats and attacks more forcefully. If economic models are to model the way that the economy actually functions, then their workings will have to incorporate these predictable patterns, not perfect reasoning or random variance.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Macroeconomic systems add an entirely different layer of complexity and are too difficult for a model or computer to accurately predict their movement over more than a very short length of time. Even the best predictions only accurately span quarters, rather than years or decades. Simple calculations cannot capture all of the movements of a large macroeconomy anymore than weather forecasters can perfectly predict exactly where a storm will bring rain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is where chess grandmasters retain the advantage over computers. Disciplined study and experience allow a grandmaster to appreciate grand strategies and nuances between positions that a computer evaluation cannot capture. These are analogous to the meta-patterns that can be captured through macroeconomic study, the policies that tend to bring long-term success even if the economist cannot predict exactly how they will play out. Much as the grandmaster cannot predict the exact sequence of moves that will cause his long-term strategy to succeed, the policymaker need not predict the sequence of economic events, only understand that it tends in the right direction.</p>
