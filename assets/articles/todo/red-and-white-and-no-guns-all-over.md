<p dir="ltr">This week on the Distilled podcast, we are taking a look at gun control in the United States. Canada and Switzerland are two countries famous in the gun control debate for quite different reasons. They are often, however, misrepresented in that discussion.</p>
<p>Canada, firstly, is a country founded without blood spilt and proud of a former prime minister for the invention of modern peacekeeping. It is a peculiar example for gun advocates.  In the US, the saga of Canada’s long gun registry, though, makes for an easy volley aimed at supporters of gun regulation. The reputation of the registry, even as expressed by the leader of Canada’s Liberal party (the creators of the registry in the 1990s),<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/pol-the-house-justin-trudeau-long-gun-registry.html"> Justin Trudeau</a>, is one of an overly expensive bureaucratic disaster. But is that reputation earned?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/index-eng.htm">Police have continually attested</a> to the usefulness of the registry in assessing the danger of situations, claiming to access it upwards of 14, 000 times daily. In a security argument, the necessary question is: should a country rely on a well-informed police force, or is the availability of vigilante justice a better way to keep its streets safe? While the former is surely preferable of the two, perhaps there is a third option.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/?page_id=1436">“useless registry”</a>, to borrow a phrase from the governing Conservative party of Canada, is said to exemplify fiscal waste. Overall, the registry cost<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/pol-gun-registry-question-answer.html"> 22 million CAD annually</a>, including handguns and other weapons besides long guns that remain registered. The savings from eliminating the long gun portion are estimated at<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/long-gun-registry_n_2034913.html"> seven million</a>. This is likely not the deficit-busting measure some claimed reversing past “big-government” policies would be.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The registry is but a small portion in the Canadian gun story though.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More importantly, Canada should be seen by the world as a country that has little gun crime simply because of the cultural marginalisation of guns. There is an element of pride in the national psyche that in many places the streets are safe enough that residents need not lock their doors. Guns are used for protection in the wilderness and little else. They are simply not at the forefront of the minds of citizens.</p>
<p>The story in Canada is one that is not told in the terms of fear, protection, and response that lead to tension and rashness. The cultural dichotomy between the Great White North and it’s southern neighbours was made comically clear <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/us-cop-blasted-for-wishing-to-carry-gun-in-calgary-park-165699436.html">during the 2012 Calgary stampede</a>. Two promoters of the festivities approached Walt Wawra, a visiting Michigan police officer, and offered him free tickets. The man then stood between the aggressively generous gentlemen and his wife in what must have been a veritable high-noon stand-off in his mind. He later reported sincerely wishing he had been carrying in order to deal with the situation more confidently. The phrase that opened the exchange, “Have you been to the stampede yet?”, has now become Canadian shorthand for American distrust of strangers and recourse to weaponry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Swiss story is another entirely, and not one of trust based on the absence of military implements. Like America, the Helvetic Confederation was founded as an independent democracy after an armed citizens’ rebellion (sparked by William Tell’s fateful quarrel with an apple). For the 800 years since,this revolution, it has maintained a world class, well-regulated militia. Because every man is conscripted and a member of the military until they are 30, powerful weapons are quite prolific. Statistically this translates into high gun ownership. The crime rate is exceedingly low as well, which should be an ideal correlation in favour of gun ownership, but this is not the whole story.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Guns in Switzerland are a common sight. Whilst taking a train or metro one is likely to spot recruits on the way to their mandatory target practice, automatic weapon in tow. Later that day while skiing in the Alps you may as well glance a troupe of mountaineering soldiers, rifles slung across their backs.</p>
<p>Just to add to the role of guns, in two parts of the country municipal referenda are decided popularly by raised hand in the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/landgemeinde-in-glarus?id=17f241ca-a367-4ba5-8576-3cf27dbe56d0"><em>landsgemeinde</em> assembly</a>. Technically, the raising of one’s military-issued weapon is equally acceptable for making one’s democratic voice heard there. The cantons that still host this tradition are Glarus and Appenzell Innerrhoden, the latter of which, it could be noted, never successfully granted women the right to vote through this pure form of direct democracy. Suffrage was only extended by federal imposition in 1992.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Yet, the Swiss example is a red herring in gun control debates.  It is simply not the case that gun crime is low because criminals fear retribution at the hands of any generic citizen who is surely armed to the teeth at any given moment. In the streets, no ordinary person can be expected to be armed.</p>
<p>First off, gun ownership in the alpine stronghold is actually only at<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/267165"> 29 percent of households</a>, compared to America’s 43 percent. Furthermore, while all males below the age of 30 may have possession of an automatic weapon, they do not have any bullets. Ammunition, which was heavily regulated when it was in private hands, is now kept at army-controlled, centralised depots. This has to do in part with trying to solve<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Switzerland_s_troubling_record_of_suicide.html?cid=8301804"> one of Europe’s highest rates of gun-related suicide</a>, a rate that is higher still in the US.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Where regards the special bond between a man and his gun, after leaving the army, Swiss males are permitted to keep their weapons. They must however have them factory-altered to remove the automatic function. This is a perfect example of why Switzerland is not a success story the NRA should latch onto. Still it is a success story; one of a highly effective nanny state that knows everything about your implements of war. It is also a country that takes care of its citizens through effective social programmes so that people do not turn to crime in the first place. It is a country that pays for this army and these social programmes with things like taxes on radio and television ownership.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be said tht capital punishment, the deterrent<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/353576218"> “required” in the minds of some gun advocates</a>, is not credited in either case with keeping down gun violence. In Canada,<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/868366138"> violence consistently fell</a> after the elimination of the death penalty.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The reality of the story of the death in most countries is very much the same as the one that sees falling rates of gun violence as cultures move away from more macabre tendencies. Allowing the second amendment to fall into obscurity is therefore the biggest piece of practical advice Canada and Switzerland can offer America.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Those who watched the <em>landsgemeinde</em> video above will have noticed not a single rifle was seen in the crowd, although those present were legally entitled to have had one and to vote with it. Guns in Switzerland are reserved quite particularly for the defense of a country that increasingly realises it does not need defending, driving ever-higher numbers of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/index.html?lang=fr">youths to opt for civil</a> rather than military national service.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Violence, in both cases, has become an afterthought. The result is that everybody is safer. Unintentionally, and in the depths of irony, Walt Wawra said it best: “In Canada, only the criminals and the police carry handguns”. Since nobody carries handguns, that must mean Canada has no criminals, Mr. Wawra. Which is only the slightest of exaggerations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The third option then, and the only truly sustainable one, is not a realist dystopia of ubiquitous deterrence. Neither armed and ready citizens nor intrusively-informed policing will ever compare in effectiveness to the very real possibility of a culture that does not derive security and confidence from firearms. Instead, it is simply a society that has no reason to live in fear.</p>
