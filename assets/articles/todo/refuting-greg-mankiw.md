excerpt: Why is economist Greg Mankiw wrong in his critique of the Great Gatsby Curve?
  Because he assumes some of us are inherently masters, and the rest of us are not.

<p dir="ltr">Greg Mankiw continued his defense of the wealthy elite in an effort to defend the makers and takers storyline that he helped Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan bring to the political debate as their economic advisor.  Last month, Mankiw released his <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/defending_the_one_percent_0.pdf">“Defending the One Percent” </a>to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/defending_the_one_percent_0.pdf">widespread derision</a> and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/gop-economist-makes-terrible-defense-of-the-1.html">mockery</a>. Now Mankiw is back at it <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/some-observations-on-great-gatsby-curve.html">with an attack</a> on former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors Alan Krueger’s Great Gatsby Curve.</p>

<p>The Great Gatsby Curve is <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Great_Gatsby_Curve">the positive relationship</a> between income inequality and intergenerational social immobility. In other words, it shows that countries with a large amount of income inequality also have low economic opportunity to move up the economic hierarchy. This is an important piece of evidence to refute the idea that there can be “equality of opportunity,” where merit will bring the best to the top no matter where their parents were on the income ladder. The strong relationship shows that countries with high equality, such as the Scandanavian countries, also have strong social mobility, while countries with high inequality, such as Brazil, China, the US and UK, all have strong hierarchies among classes. It dispels the myth that libertarian policies are actually meritocratic.</p>
<p>Mankiw, a chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors under George W. Bush, tells us that he finds the results of the Great Gatsby Curve unsurprising. In defending his position, he gives us a thought experiment that beautifully demonstrates the limits of his assumptions and his thinking.</p>
<p>[quote align="center" color="#999999"]</p>
<p>Suppose we collected data on various chess clubs (nations). In every club, we have data on each member’s win-loss record over the year (income). We can then measure the variance of individuals’ win-loss records (inequality). We can also measure how a person's win-loss record in one year predicts his win-loss record in the subsequent year (mobility).</p>
<p>Some clubs have a bunch of players with similar levels of skill at chess. In this case, everyone would have a win-lose (sic) record that is close to each other, and a person’s club ranking one year would not have a lot of predictive value for his ranking the next. That is, we would have small inequality and substantial mobility.</p>
<p>Other clubs are more heterogeneous. They have some masters and some novices. The masters have much better records than the novices, and their better records tend to persist year to year. That is, we would have substantial inequality and little mobility.</p>
<p>If we put all these clubs together in a scatterplot, we would get something <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/some-observations-on-great-gatsby-curve.html" target="_blank">close to the Great Gatsby curve</a>.</p>

<p>Mankiw is a smart guy. His textbooks are some of the most popular introductory economics textbooks in the world. This example does show that the Great Gatsby Curve could arise from the fact that one group is simply better than the other group and the inequality follows from the fact that masters deign to grace the novice players with their presence. However, this result follows from his extremely unrealistic assumption that people either are masters or are novices. It completely breaks down if we allow for the possibility that players might use their results to decide whether to become better players.</p>
<p>Take the exact same example chess clubs, but say that these chess games result in economic rewards, just as happens in the economic system that Mankiw uses this example to defend. Players get money every time they win a tournament, so that there is an economic incentive to win more tournaments. Improving at chess means that players earn more money for their skills.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the results in the two clubs. Players in the first club, where players start out approximately equal, will have a strong incentive to improve their play. If a player is able to significantly improve his performance through hard work and training, then he will be able to surpass his less diligent peers at the club. Hard working players will have the incentive to work hard because they will see substantial rewards for surpassing lazy players and winning tournaments.</p>
<p>Now consider the club where players are primarily masters and novices. Because it takes years of practice and study for a novice-level player to become a master, novices have little immediate incentives to improve. Moving from a novice to an intermediate player will see little returns where intermediate players are still several levels away from masters because there is always a master lurking at the next level of the tournament. Only the players that are willing to sacrifice without immediate rewards for years, educating themselves and working as hard as possible, will move from the novice pool all the way to the master category. Only at that point will they be able to reap the rewards of a master.</p>
<p>This is the proper analogy for societies on the highly unequal end of the Great Gatsby Curve, such as the US and UK. It remains possible to move from the worst to the first, but it is much less likely. In the first chess club, every player had an incentive to improve his play. In the second, only the most dedicated or most talented had any real incentive to improve. What the Great Gatsby Curve shows is that wealth now gives rich children the huge advantage that masters had in the second club. One look at education spending growth by the richest and poorest Americans demonstrates the origin of this advantage.</p>

<p>Mankiw’s assumption, that some people naturally work harder than others, is ubiquitous in economics and follows in the tradition of great minds before him. Milton Friedman in Capitalism and Freedom concluded that we should allow the market to decide whether we have racially-segregated schools, thinking that markets would simply sort out which system provided better education outcomes. Parents would rationally choose the school that provided the best outcome, and that school would win in the market.</p>
<p>This argument used the same Platonic assumption that people either are racist or aren’t racist; those views are not affected by choice of schooling system. Once we allow for the fact that the school system might make people racist, the whole structure breaks down, just as Mankiw’s structure breaks down if you allow for the fact that the structure of the system might make people work hard. If the existence of segregated schools makes some people believe that they are superior and others inferior, as Brown v. Board of Education and countless studies have determined, then the logical structure crumbles.</p>
<p>Mankiw shows that he subscribes to the same worldview that Friedman held before him: there are some people that are superior to others, and markets simply sort out who is the best person. At Distilled, we take a different view, holding that there are important interactions between an economic system and a person’s motivation that make it so that markets are not simply determining who is better. Markets provide the basis for motivations and change important preferences and beliefs that people hold. Under this more nuanced interpretation, the results of a market become much more complex and less susceptible to simplistic mathematical or economic manipulation.</p>
<p>If you share our belief that market structures can determine people’s motivations, we invite you to explore the consequences with us as we shape our magazine around examining them.</p>
