<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">    The dénouement of the now infamous 90% debt threshold paper by Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff was swift and embarrassing.  For those new to the story, in 2010, Reinhart and Rogoff published a study arguing that “median growth rates for countries with public debt over roughly 90 percent of GDP are about one percent lower than otherwise; average (mean) growth rates are several percent lower.”<a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/rogoff/files/growth_in_time_debt_aer.pdf‎" target="_blank">[1]</a>  It was published in the Papers and Proceedings issue of the American Economic Review, one of the most prestigious journals in economics. This was an issue of the journal whose papers do not go through the usual peer review process.  Reinhart-Rogoff’s paper was immediately cited widely for its timely and alarming result that there appeared to be a threshold at a public debt ratio of 90 percent of GDP that indicated a strong decrease in economic growth.<a href=" http://qz.com/75117/how-influential-was-the-study-warning-high-debt-kills-growth" target="_blank">[2]</a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">    Former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner called it “an excellent study.”<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/committeehearings?ContentRecord_id=9f8d731e-4313-4b3b-9e86-23136c18c36f&amp;ContentType_id=14f995b9-dfa5-407a-9d35-56cc7152a7ed&amp;Group_id=d68d31c2-2e75-49fb-a03a-be915cb4550b&amp;MonthDisplay=2&amp;YearDisplay=2011" target="_blank">[3]</a>  Prominent economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin called Reinhart and Rogoff’s work canonical and wholly endorsed their conclusion.<a href=" http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/feb/14/get-us-government-spending-under-control" target="_blank">[4]</a>  In Europe, European Commissioner Olli Rehn<a href=" http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/rehn/documents/cab20130213_en.pdf" target="_blank">[5]</a> and, in the United States, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan used the study to scold opponents and promote strong and immediate austerity programs.<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/documentsingle1.aspx?DocumentID=248275" target="_blank">[6]</a>  It was a prominent and topic piece of evidence in the ongoing debate over austerity policies.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">     Last spring, Thomas Herndon discovered, while working on a project to recreate the results of a prominent economic study, that he could not recreate Reinhart and Rogoff’s results.  In fact, after much wrangling with the authors to obtain their original data set, he was able to discover that their results could not be replicated because they were wrong.  Reinhart and Rogoff had made a spreadsheet error that omitted data that significantly weakened their results.  Once the spreadsheet error was corrected, their alarming results evaporate and there is no major threshold showing lower growth from debt above 90 percent.<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/5661" target="_blank">[7]</a>  Later research has shown no evidence that debt leads to lower growth, and if anything, the relationship would move in the opposite direction, with lower growth causing debt to grow more quickly.<a href=" http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/30/reinhart-rogoff-debunked_n_3361299.html" target="_blank">[8]</a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">      This story has been well-reported and sensationalized, not least because of the apparently obvious mistake of making a spreadsheet error.  However, in reviewing the episode, I would like to look at a different aspect of the story.  Why in the world was this paper ever considered “an excellent study” in the first place, regardless of any spreadsheet mistake?  Looking under the Reinhart Rogoff hood, this is not the type of research that should be the basis of policy decisions with or without any mistakes.  The fact that this type of research served as the basis for Congressional testimony<a href=" http://www.peri.umass.edu/236/hash/31e2ff374b6377b2ddec04deaa6388b1/publication/566/" target="_blank">[9]</a> is embarrassing to Congress, the economists themselves, and perhaps the entire idea of economic analysis.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">    The Reinhart and Rogoff conclusions were based on exactly 96 data points, 96 measurements of economic performance with debt over 90 percent of GDP spanning advanced countries throughout the globe over the period 1946 to 2009.  After their spreadsheet error, 25 years of data about Belgium were removed, lowering their calculated years to 71.<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/5661" target="_blank">[10]</a>  Already, this is an absurdly low number to make any relevant conclusions.  Reaching a debt to GDP ratio above 90 percent has been an unusual and extreme time, as can be seen by the low frequency of the data.  The idea that you would get an idea of the “average” extreme event from so few data points is ridiculous.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">    Their next step was considerably more ridiculous.  Faced with the problem that data on a single country is likely to be serially correlated, that is, if a country had many years of high debt, its growth rates would likely to follow one from the next.  Just as today’s weather is more likely to be similar to yesterday’s weather, last year’s GDP is likely to be similar to this year’s.  This type of serial correlation is an issue for many data sets, and something must be done to account for the effect.  However, what Reinhart and Rogoff did was extreme.  They took all of the years of data from each country and averaged them into one number.  This meant that the 19 years of solid growth with high debt in Greece and the 19 years of solid growth with high debt in the U.K. were weighted equally to New Zealand’s single year of extremely negative growth.<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/5661" target="_blank">[11]</a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Using this method of weighting lowers the number of data points to 8 averages of countries that had debt ratios over 90 percent (7 countries after their spreadsheet error removed Belgium).  The idea that we could glean an accurate impression of the general behavior of high debt countries from this type of data seems absurd on its face.  Let’s take a look at the 8 episodes in question.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Two of the periods are the U.S. and U.K. immediately following World War II.  The U.S. period of debt over 90 percent is just four years, while the U.K. remained high for 19 years.[12]  These were highly unusual years for these economies, as they sought to reintegrate returning soldiers into the workforce and rekindle demand after wartime spending and strict rationing.  To say that these were unique economic times in a capitalist economy is an understatement.  New Zealand is included in the sample just for 1951, despite being over the threshold from 1946-1949 as well.  The  1951 Waterfront Dispute featured the largest industrial confrontation in the history of New Zealand, with a strike that lasted for 151 days of the year.<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/the-1951-waterfront-dispute1" target="_blank">[13]</a>  This extraordinarily anomalous year is weighted so that it is 1/7th of the final average at -7.9%, way out of line with any other growth rate.  Interestingly, if 1946-1949 had been included, New Zealand’s average would have been 2.2% growth, over 10% higher.<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/5661" target="_blank">[14]</a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Three of the other periods have become familiar during the current crisis.  Japan has had debt above 90 percent debt to GDP since 1999, a condition brought about by its lost decade of the 1990s following a real estate crash.  If there was an effect when Japan went over 90 percent, it has been lost on observers, who have seen Japan in an unending and steady morose.  This is a clear example of low growth causing high debt, rather than vice versa.  It might, however, be the most relevant experience to our current economic conditions.  As familiar are Italy and Greece, who built up large amounts of debt in the 1990s and on through lax taxation, profligate spending, and relatively cheap borrowing costs.  Although these periods might be relevant to low growth, they are also strong candidates for Granger causation, where bad institutions create high debt and lower growth simultaneously.  This would invalidate any causal connection between debt and growth.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Finally, there is Ireland in the 1980s before its explosion as the “Celtic tiger.”  This was a period of rising debts despite severe cuts in spending, and poor economic performance has been attributed most significantly to poor macroeconomic policymaking.<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Finance_a_Uver1.pdf" target="_blank">[15]</a>  Ireland emerged from this period, and left the ranks of the 90 percent debt, with a change in fiscal strategy and numerous positive shocks.<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Finance_a_Uver1.pdf" target="_blank">[16]</a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Using these 7 episodes, each distilled down to a single average, Reinhart and Rogoff reached a conclusion about the relationship between debt and growth that they considered worthy of publishing.  Furthermore, they brought these results to public policy attention and went so far as to testify in front of Congress to advocate action.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Simple Average of 2.9%, 2.4%, 1%, .7%, -7.9%, 2.4%, and -2.0%:                         -.07%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">    This is the number that Reinhart and Rogoff ran with.  Negative growth (even if it is very mild) is a wide departure from typical growth, which is around 3% or so.  This is the basis of Reinhart and Rogoff going in front of Congress warning about the dangers of 90 percent debt to GDP.  This simple average of seven averages.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">    Of course, anyone who has taken middle-school biology might look at this set of observations and think that something is amiss.  Negative 7.9 percent growth is a massive outlier that appears to be significantly altering the results.  After all, if we were to remove that single year from our consideration, our average would jump up to 1.06 percent growth.  Considering that this observation was the only single-year observation and that it featured a 151-day strike at the ports of an island country, New Zealand, the longest in its history, there is no justification for leaving it in this data set.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">   The only other negative average comes from the U.S., and its inclusion is dubious as well.  During this period, the United States was demobilizing on two fronts from the largest war in history.  If anything, it is widely believed that the United States had surprisingly good economic performance over this period, considering the possible downsides of this level of demobilization.  Moreover, Reinhart and Rogoff do not adequately explain why the U.S. post-war data is included, while post-war data from 1946-1950 is excluded for Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.  If New Zealand’s data from 1946-1949 were included, its massively negative 7.9 percent growth would transform into positive 2.6% growth over 5 years of observations.<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Finance_a_Uver1.pdf" target="_blank">[18]</a>  The decision to selectively include one year of New Zealand data and not four years immediately prior made a 10.5 percent difference in what amounted to a seven data-point sample.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">    If we simply included the observations from 1946-1950 Australia, Canada, and New Zealand to the sample, giving them averages of 3.8%, 3.0%, and 2.6%, respectively, plus the Belgium data omitted because of the spreadsheet error, 2.6%, we would get a simple average of 1.94 percent.  This average still includes the bizarre single-average-per-country weighting.  Without that bizarre weighting, considering every year as a single observation, the average growth comes out to 2.2 percent, the result reached by Thomas Herndon with Michael Ash and Robert Pollin.<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Finance_a_Uver1.pdf" target="_blank">[19]</a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Throwing all of these situations into the same data set is terrible.  Econometrics is done with the idea that we are trying to find a single causal connection in an underlying system.  The idea is that there is noise around an imbedded signal.  Like a decoder ring, econometrics should be able to control for distracting uncertainty to determine the true causal relationship of the underlying variables.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">This is not that.  It is mashing together fundamentally different circumstances, taking a simple average, and declaring a breakpoint at 90 percent debt to GDP.  There is nothing technocratic about this at all.  The results are driven by simple outliers and entirely determined by unjustified decisions made by the famous researchers.  It cannot be ignored that the economists in question Reinhart and Rogoff are conservative economists who stood to gain in prestige for creating research in support of austerity-type policies, but I do not think that is the main story here.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The main story is that basic, questionable judgments by the authors drove the research conclusions.  That data from periods of demobilization, labor troubles, fiscal profligacy, and financial crisis may be fundamentally incommensurable did not stop the authors from taking a simple average and declaring a significant relationship.  Reinhart and Rogoff have since diminished the impact of their mistake by emphasizing that growth did in fact fall beyond 90 percent even after the correction.  Of course, this objection misses the point entirely.  Paul Ryan, Olli Rehn, and Reinhart and Rogoff themselves argued that immediate action was required to avoid falling over a significant threshold.  A minor negative correlation that just as easily shows that low growth leads to high debt as that high debt leads to low growth does not amount to the same argument.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">More significantly, I call into question the entire methodology of looking back in time to categorize countries according to their debt levels.  Reinhart and Rogoff released a more comprehensive study in 2012 with Vincent Reinhart that looks at a larger data set over the period from 1800 to the present.<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/5661" target="_blank">[20]</a>  This paper expands to 26 episodes of five years or longer.<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/5661" target="_blank">[21]</a>  However, even with this bigger data set, methodological questions abound.  How can we trust such a small set of observations?  Why are post-war times fundamentally similar enough to compare to times of financial crisis or fiscal profligacy?  Are economic relationships between aggregates such as government debt fundamentally unchanged from the 19th century economy to the 20th century?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">There simply is not enough data to answer these questions in a technocratic way.  We really cannot move beyond simple historical analogies without adopting a highly debatable methodology.  This does not come down to a spreadsheet error.  This was not “excellent” or “canonical” in any way.  It is selling unsupported economic conclusions to our elected rubes looking for miracle cures.  It is time that we pull the curtain back on the Wizard of Oz and take a realistic look at what our technocratic data analysts can provide.</p>
