<p style="text-align: justify;">The elections are over. Obama has won.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a few tense weeks, Europe could finally let slip a sigh of relief. French president François Hollande said that he was pleased with America’s choice for an <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/121107_Obamawint_Europesereacties">‘open and tolerant’</a> country. Herman Van Rompuy <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/121107_Obamawint_Europesereacties">tweeted</a> to be ‘very pleased with Obama’s re-election’, only realising after a few minutes that the first word might sound a bit too biased for a president of the European Council. In order to take away all doubt, Spain’s minister of foreign affairs, José-Manuel García-Margallo, bluntly stated that ‘<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/noticia-margallo-reeleccion-obama-ganado-20121107104049.html">our candidate has won</a>’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The commentaries in the media were no different. Wolfgang Blau declared on the website of <em>Die Zeit</em> that even the Germans, who generally did not care, should be <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/seite-2">grateful</a> for the Democrat’s victory. The Dutch newspaper <em>Trouw</em> was quite critical of Obama’s first term, but nevertheless displayed <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Het-maakt-nog-wel-uit-wie-er-wint-in-de-VS.dhtml">relief</a> that he remains in power until 2016.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But why should we be grateful? Did not those very same politicians and commentators indeed confirm that Obama’s record is far from perfect? Did Europe simply cheer for a disappointment in order to avoid a disaster?</p>
<p>I believe not.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mediatheek">conversation</a> with political strategist Alice Stewart on the Belgian national television, the interviewer noted that many Europeans see Obama’s victory as a sign that Americans  ‘have chosen for hope instead of despair and bitterness’. This question reveals as much about the European state of mind as about any American attitude.</p>
<p>Since 2008, the European Union has been in a spiral of bad news and negativism. The project we were once so proud of has been tainted by financial and political sores. Instead of being exemplary of a new form of politics, the EU is now deemed to be a megalomane project, undemocratically imposed upon its subjects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2436202727"><img class="alignleft" title="Picture by Sheila_Bligh" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Picture-by-Sheila_Bligh-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="250" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of believing in integration, nationalism is increasingly considered a better alternative. Instead of reaching its hand to the people, the European bureaucracy kept launching plan after plan, stubbornly refusing to communicate about why we should endorse them.  Instead of outright pride, the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to over sixty years of peace met with almost universal disbelief and cynicism.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Confronted with hardship, still tainted by a much darker past, afraid of the word populism, the European leaders have neglected to make their project ours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This will no longer do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why? Because people need to believe in a better future. Because we need to believe in <em>our own</em> ability to construct a better future. And this is why Europeans want to believe in Obama. Seemingly abandoned by the leaders of their own greater union, they look across the Atlantic for a spark of hope.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And on Wednesday, they might have found it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, Obama made mistakes. Yes, he did not execute everything he promised. Yes, some of his decisions can be called dubious. And yes, this is as much his own fault as that of the mess left by George W. Bush and his sturdy compatriots in congress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2012, the ruptures in the American fabric became apparent. The campaign was of an appalling level, becoming personal on numerous occasions. The country split in two between the communist Obama and rich man Romney. Aided by an increasingly polarized media, people could freely chose who they wanted to hate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But despite all of this, I can at least believe in Obama’s project. I refuse to be cynical when he breaks into tears in his campaign headquarters. I refuse to be cynical when he talks about reuniting the divided United States. I refuse to be cynical when he declares that, despite the odds, the best is yet to come.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But again, why?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because in 2008, Obama’s slogan was ‘Yes we can’. Not I can, not the U.S. can, but we can. This is a message that stands, even after four years. It is a message that provides hope, that calls everyone to action. It is a call for a better future, based on equality, where people themselves defend the values on which this future rests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because in 2012, Obama again represented this hope. For those who sincerely listened, his victory speech and subsequent declarations made clear that he wants to unite and bind, not divide and fight. After four years he knows this is not an easy task, but he has not given up. He is battle-scarred, but has not abandoned the vision that won him the presidency in 2008. And he will again try to change things for the better, to the best of his ability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because I too want to vote against despair and bitterness. Because I wish I had a similar project to support. Because I want a similar belief to fight for.  A similar dream to cherish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because for the four next years, I will wish I could have been an American.</p>
