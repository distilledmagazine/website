<p style="text-align: justify;">It seems as if Warren and Brandeis, authors of the The Right to Privacy, one of the classic writings concerning privacy, had a crystal ball. As early as 1890 they wrote that “instantaneous photographs and newspaper enterprise have invaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life; (…) what is whispered in the closet shall be proclaimed from the house-tops’. In July 2011 it was revealed that the phones of, among others, relatives of deceased British soldiers and victims of the 2005 London bombings were wiretapped by the no longer existing British newspaper News of the World. Public reactions were furious and devastating for the newspaper, leading to its dissolution on 10 July 2011 and terminating 168 years of publication. Following this scandal, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced an investigation which resulted in the publication of the Leveson report on 29 November 2012.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this short essay I will examine why there was such a public commotion regarding this practice. An obvious answer seems to be ‘because News of the World violated and invaded the private sphere of these victims’. But why is this violation problematic? After all, what has a good citizen to fear from this violation if he or she has nothing to hide? Indeed, nothing. It are only people wanting to hide their ‘dark’ and illegal practices that have something to fear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This, in a nutshell, is the ‘nothing to hide argument’ (from now on NTH argument), which is frequently used in defence of practices which enable governments to invade the private sphere of citizens with regard to the state security.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the claim that the value of privacy is overruled by the value and importance of state security has grown in popularity, especially in the United States. Since then, the U.S. government has extensively raised the level of surveillance and data mining of citizens. The underlying assumption ‘justifying’ these practices, as said, is that privacy interests are outbalanced by security concerns. After all, what do you have to hide if you’re a good and well behaving citizen? As I will point out, I think that the value of privacy differs in diverse contexts, which undermines the claim that security concerns always outbalance privacy interests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The problem with the NTH argument, according to Daniel Solove, is “the underlying assumption that privacy is about hiding bad things”. He argues that privacy is a pluralistic conception. I think Solove is right, since there are a lot of contexts concerning privacy issues where an argument focussing on state security or, more general, revealing dark practices has nothing to say. For example, not wanting any state interference regarding decisions about abortion or euthanasia has nothing to do with hiding a wrong. In order to further illustrate this pluralistic conception of privacy I refer to the differences between privacy issues regarding direct marketing and cybersurveillance. The former takes place in a seller-buyer context, while the latter consists of an employer-employee relationship.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But if privacy is not (always) about hiding bad things, what is it that makes it valuable? Why did the revelation of the wiretapping phones of citizens by a newspaper result in a public outcry? Why do we care about our privacy? And why are we concerned about violations against it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think that the value of privacy is inextricably linked to our human nature. And more specific, the fact that we are social creatures which are continuously forming relationships and alliances with one another. James Rachels’ answer to the question why we value privacy is linked to this social aspect of the human nature. We think socially and are social. He claims that the nature of our relationships with other people and, as a consequence, how we behave among other people, is influenced by what others know about us. We behave different among our best friends than we behave at work because we maintain a different social relationship with friends than we do with colleagues. According to Rachels, a right to privacy is valuable because it enables us to have social relationships of diverse nature with different people. Without protection of our privacy it would become difficult to monitor who knows what about us, leading to the impossibility of having social relationships with others, distinctive in nature. The value of privacy can thus be grounded in the connection between our ability to monitor and to control who has access to information about us and our ability to build and sustain social relationships with diverse people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A possible critique to this view is that, despite a lack of privacy protection, we would still be able to build and sustain diverse relationships with others. On the one hand, it is not the case that everyone, although they would be able to know everything about us, would be willing to support and help us in difficult times. On the other hand, our inner thoughts would, even without privacy protection, remain inaccessible for strangers. We would still be able to determine for ourselves who we tell our dreams and desires. One could also wonder whether things are as simple as Rachel presents them to be. Could it not be the case that what we tell to others is influenced by the nature of our relationship? It seems thus to be the case that privacy is not the only factor influencing the nature of our social relationships. Yet privacy is definitely able to influence the ‘depth’ of the relationships we build, since it enables us to determine who knows what.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But is this all there is to say about what makes privacy valuable for us? Certainly not. Just as I think that the privacy concept is pluralistic in nature, I think that what makes privacy valuable has many dimensions. Freddy Mortier for example argues that the value and the importance of privacy in our culture has grown to what it is today from multiple socio-historical processes. A discussion of these processes would lead us to far, but it should be clear that privacy is valuable, even if we’ve nothing to hide. Regarding this fact, the nearly prophetic words of Warren and Brandeis dating from 1890 can be iterated today. Whenever the press makes use of methods, like the wiretapping of telephones, to retrieve private information about citizens in an unauthorized way, the press “is overstepping in every direction the obvious bounds of propriety and of decency”.</p>
