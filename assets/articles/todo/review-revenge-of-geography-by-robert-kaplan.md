<p style="text-align: justify;">"A good place to understand the present, and to ask questions about the future, is on the ground, traveling as slowly as possible." <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Robert_D._Kaplan">Robert Kaplan</a>, author of "<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/B007MDJY5K">Revenge of Geography</a>" begins with this truism. Who could possibly object?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meet Mr. <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Thomas_Friedman">Thomas L. Friedman</a>, columnist for the New York Times and commander of speaking fees that would make even motivational speakers blanche. "I was in Bangalore, India, the Silicon Valley of India, when I realized that the world was flat." from the unsurprisingly titled "<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/The_world_is_flat">The World is Flat</a>".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am chagrined to reveal that the distinguished Mr. Friedman sees the world from within indistinguishable air-conditioned hotel rooms and from high-atop business-class cabins.</p>
<p><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/review-revenge-of-geography-by-robert-kaplan/kaplan/" rel="attachment wp-att-2480"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2480" alt="kaplan" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/kaplan-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kaplan, the author of previous travelogues/surveys of global politics such as Monsoon, Balkan Ghosts, and Eastward to Tartary, lays out the guiding light of his latest installment in an explicit rebuke of the Friedman-ism that dominates the Aspen/Davos class:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?-->"The only thing enduring is a people’s position on the map. Thus, in times of upheaval maps rise in importance. With the political ground shifting rapidly under one’s feet, the map, though not determinitive, is the beginning of discerning a historical logic about what might come next."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Kaplan is keen to point out in his introduction, this book was necessitated by the preponderance of authors and foreign affairs commentators declaring that "<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/flat-n-all-that">the world is flat</a>", and that the great forces of globalization, technology, and commerce have reduced nations to mere bystanders of history. Perhaps the most amusing and tragic example of the importance of an on-the-ground understanding of a place told by Kaplan is the seeming unawareness of American military commanders of the vast difficulty of moving troops across Kuwait and southern Iraq into Baghdad.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Geography places limits on outcomes – we have yet to develop technology that moves mountains and shifts deserts. Not to say geography is fatal, but it does set the stage for human interaction in specific ways. For example geography ensures that certain places, like Tunisia, are always a centre for the spread of information, culture, ideas, military power, etc. (from the Phoenicians to Carthage to the Arab Uprisings).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kaplan emphasizes this point through similar illustrative examples that are drawn largely from his previous books. It is through this large middle-section of the book in which Kaplan becomes mired in details and bogged down in pet frameworks and strategies that sometimes bear little connection to physical or cultural geography.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nonetheless, Kaplan does go to great lengths to plot the intellectual history of the golden age of geopolitics in the early-20th century, framed in the context of two World Wars. Kaplan does his best to validate these various lenses of geopolitics using real-world examples of geography dictating politics, such as the inability of governments to control the flow of insurgents and weapons across the Durrand Line which separates Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the continued exercise of Russian power over its periphery states and its consequent geographic insecurity complex.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But "Revenge of Geography" only becomes truly interesting in its final chapter when it turns its eyes toward the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quite simply the world has become in many ways unmanageable. Worse, it has escaped our ability to understand it using the old frames of reference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the stage Kaplan has set – crowded with the moldy set dressings of interminable conflicts surrounded by a chorus of well-fed, fretful men – we are introduced to French historian <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Fernand_Braudel">Fernand Braudel</a>, a leader of the Annales school and a proponent of la longue durée.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Braudel, in Kaplan's view, is "more than a geographer or strategist". He is a historian weaving a narrative, and in Braudel's version of the geopolitical story, change occurs over varying "wavelengths" of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this narrative, history is like an ocean. The big geographical changes are like the Gulf Stream, so massive and slow moving that the changes are imperceptible, until it hits another massive body. Systemic changes are like the tide, where the change occurs over a much shorter period of time but still produces a great impact. The day-to-day changes that dominate the 24-hour cable news cycle are like the waves and flecks of surf at the juncture between sea and sky, ephemeral and relatively inconsequential.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is with Braudel's perspective, that of several layers of change operating on different time frames and magnitudes, Kaplan speculates about the long-term future of North America. Will the eventual outcome of immigration, cultural integration, and security concerns lead to the formation of a Toynbee-an Universal State between Canada, the USA, and Mexico? Or will we splinter into ever smaller states?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kaplan envisions a future world where the nation-state has dissolved into nations and states, a political order that resembles the Ottoman Empire and its millet system of "geographically intermingled communities". This political order would certainly help to address some of the limits placed on current nation-states by geography while also acknowledging the particular areas where geography can be overcome. Examples of such systems abound now in Europe. Certainly Gibraltar shares more in common geographically with the Spanish mainland than it does with the British Isles, yet it retains its cultural and national link to the UK with the help of transportation and communications technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sociologist Emile Durkheim envisioned just such a political order consisting of several interlocking, nested, overlapping groups. Such a view of global society as posited by Durkheim and Kaplan is certainly compelling, considering how technology has allowed us to form all manner of social communities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But what would tie these various political and social groups together? We can look to states to provide guidance. States use, among many tools, national identity and ideology to bind its citizens into a community with collective purpose. These are powerful narratives about who a people were, who they are now, and where they are going together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If the state were to deteriorate, or compete with other forms of social organization, these narratives would become much more complex. They narrative requires using all the tools of telling a story at our disposal. These tools include intelligence, folk stories, data, and of course, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/report-mapstory-a-new-way-to-understand-change/">maps</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now we come full circle. Maps aren't just prose or poetry. They are both. They tell a story embedded within physical and cultural geography. Any adaptable political order suited for the rapid changes of 21st century mass society would rely on narratives that weave together our collective social responsibility and identity at all levels – our local community, our cultural and national communities, our state, and even our super-state (such as the EU).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Kaplan lays out in the introduction of the book:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"By engaging with old maps, and with geographers and geopolitical thinkers from earlier eras, I want to ground-truth the globe in the twenty-first century much as I did at these frontiers beginning in the late twentieth. For even if we can send satellites into the outer solar system— and even as financial markets and cyberspace know no boundaries— the Hindu Kush still constitutes a formidable barrier".</p>
