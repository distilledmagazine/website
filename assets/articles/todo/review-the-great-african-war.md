<p style="text-align: justify;">What happens when researchers study a topic which seems to be composed of continued violence, recurring inhumanities and unending misery?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Usually they have two options. One possibility is to choose the road of academic detachment, and to avoid clear commentaries in the general media. The other option is to become engaged, which means losing some scholarly credibility in order to improve the situation of your object of study. Filip Reyntjes, specialist on contemporary Congo of the University of Antwerp, is however a rare example of someone who manages to combine both approaches.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/0511590520.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1995" title="0511590520" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/0511590520-189x300.jpg" width="189" height="300" /></a>To be fair, even someone as Reyntjes has his limits. After the recent upsurge of violence in the Kivu-region of the DRC, the scholar reached for his pen and wrote some strong-phrased articles about the situation in the former Belgian colony. With titles as ‘Congo has been sabotaged for years, and Rwanda is an active participant in this’ or ‘Rwanda harasses Congo, with the regards of Belgium’ these texts clearly went beyond any detached analysis. The header of another piece demonstrated why he now struck a harder tone: ‘When will the international community finally deal with the Congolese Déjà-vu’s?’ is a question many of us indeed have posed, but few have answered without frustration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For Reyntjes, the anger and resentment will only run deeper. The scenario that unfolded since March 2012 (and is described by Simon Seroussi in the Distilled Report), reads like a cheap copy of his The Great African War. Congo and Regional Geopolitics, 1996-2006. If something like political plagiarism would be punishable, many actors in Central Africa could add one more crime to their record. Although Reyntjes will not cheer for this fact, the similarity between the events of 2012 and those of 1996-2006 however makes his book an excellent introduction to today’s conflict. Let me highlight two aspects</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides providing a great overview, the book takes an interesting perspective on the conflict. Instead of focussing on elements such as warlordship or the general ineptness of the Congolese state, the central approach is that of geopolitics. This is not to say that this is an old-fashioned description of state diplomacy. Rather it is stressed that behind most events in the Great Lakes Region lurks the shady presence of wannabe-superpower Rwanda. This ‘army with a state’ as Reyntjes calls it (p.4), manages to exert influence in disproportion to its size and wealth. Aided by the moral high ground obtained after the genocide of 1994, Rwanda ‘explored the limits of tolerance, crossing one Rubicon after another, and realised that there were none’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed, one aspect that Reyntjes clearly shows is that the international community has responded in a rather dubious way. In a first phase Western powers tried to manage the conflict to their own geopolitical interests. This resulted in the rather interesting situation that ‘French soldiers that were not there recovered the bodies of American soldiers that were not there either’ (p.116). After these powers realised what kind of snake-pit the Congo had become, they quickly withdrew to the safer position of providing lip-service to the peace-keeping mission still in place today, as long as there were no (official) casualties. As mentioned above, this is largely the situation where we still are today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are only two of the central points of the book, but if you want a thorough geopolitical introduction to the misery in and around the DRC, and if you can handle the idea that you have already read this some weeks ago in your own newspaper, then Reyntjes analysis is a perfect start.</p>
