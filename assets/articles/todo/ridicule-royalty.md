<p>For some countries it just makes sense to have royals and nobility. I’m thinking places where people still measure distance in miles, land in acres, and volume in pints. That might explain why President Obama <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/opinion/friedman-blowing-a-whistle.html" target="_blank">is allowed</a> to rule more and more <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/will-obama-block-release-of-yemeni-journalist-again" target="_blank">like an unchecked monarch</a>, and why the Walton family can <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Criticism_of_Walmart#Employee_and_labor_relations" target="_blank">treat its employees like feudal serfs</a>. It all makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>I’m from a country that doesn’t make sense though. In Belgium we already had a properly established metric system in place when we — after weighing pros and cons in nice, logical kilogrammes — decided to crown a king anyway. On 21 July 1831 a German nobleman called Leopold Von Sachsen-Coburg-Saalfeld took the oath as first King of Belgium, after allegedly asking the senators five times in a thick German accent whether the whole thing really wasn’t “some kind of crazy Belgian joke”. At least, that’s what he should have asked, because it's the only reasonable explanation why Belgium would have chosen for a monarchy forty years <em>after</em> the French Revolution: as a practical joke by the senators who in the end didn’t have the heart to tell their oblivious victim that it was a set-up, and decided to continue the theatre for him and his heirs. A transgenerational version of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/watch?v=SC8HTpEWrm0" target="_blank"><em>Goodbye Lenin</em></a>, if you will.</p>
<p>I apologise for boring you with all this nonsense on royals you couldn't care less about, but this is what I've been faced with all week. It seemed this was all the media really cared about. Move aside <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/detroit-bankruptcy/" target="_blank">Detroit</a>, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/japan-abe-stimulate-recovery/" target="_blank">Japan</a>, and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/bipartisan-climate-change/" target="_blank">continuous threat of global climatic catastrophe</a>, the new kings are coming! Still, as European-on-call at Distilled this week, it's my duty to report on these absurdities.</p>

<p class="caption">OMG, it's the Royal Baby!</p>
</div>
<p>Let me start by explaining the overall State of the Monarchy on this casually medieval continent. Actually, that's probably the best phrase to summarise our monarchies: casually medieval. Their existence is an outdated remnant of the Middle Ages, but luckily for us what's left is a very relaxed, watered-down version of the institution. Bound by constitutions, the monarchs of Europe have virtually no power left. (Exception for the interested: the Prince of Lichtenstein still has <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Liechtenstein#Government" target="_blank">considerable real authority</a> over his massive empire.) So that's good, but let's go deeper into the specifics of last week's developments in the world of the Euristocracy.</p>
<p>Next up, the big story: Britain's got a royal baby. For ease, let's call him Prince George. When I wrote this Kate and William were still <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/royal-baby-parents-present-world" target="_blank">"working on a name"</a>, but "George" is favourite with the bookies, so that'll do. For him personally things look good, because in April the British parliament abolished primogeniture. This means that women are now treated equally when it comes to succession to the British throne. So good news for Prince George. I he wants to, he could in a few years time safely change his gender to Princess Georgina while marrying <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Norman_Tebbit#Homosexuality" target="_blank">Norman Tebbit's</a> decomposed corpse, and still claim her rightful place as Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The 21st century smiles upon you, Prince(ss) Georg(ina)!</p>
<p>There's a catch though, and as usual here in Britain that is the gutter press. The tabloids took this opportunity to show their real, ugly face once more. In this particular case the prize for "Most Disgusting Coverage" goes to the <em>Daily Mail</em>. Ever since the Royal Wedding in 2011, they have been on "bump watch", reducing Kate to nothing more than a carrier of royal offspring. Hillary Mantel was unjustly vilified when <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/royal-bodies" target="_blank">she pointed this out</a>: "The press will find that this young woman’s life until now was nothing, her only point and purpose being to give birth." I'm not going to link a rag like the Daily Mail, but take it from me that she got it spot on. Their current coverage on Kate exemplifies their view on women in general, and it could have easily made a version of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Daily_Mail_and_General_Trust#History" target="_blank">the Mail anno 1938</a>.</p>
<p>Britain wasn't the only place with royalty news this week. For more we return to Belgium. On 21 July King Phillippe finally succeeded his retiring father Albert. For years the Belgian press has been questioning whether he's "good enough" to be king. They keep forgetting that the bar has been set very low. Even though they have been constitutionally powerless ever since 1830, Belgian kings have found ways to screw up nevertheless. Leopold II for instance became infamous internationally by claiming the entire territory of Congo as his personal fiefdom, and instating there what's still considered one of the worst instances of European colonialism in history. His namesake Leopold III sank even deeper. When Belgium was occupied by the Nazis in 1940, Leopold decided to stay. He then tried to convince his new friend Hitler to reinstate him as King of Belgium, but this time without a pesky constitution limiting his absolute power. Whatever he does, King Phillippe will have to try very hard to be worse than Leo #2 and #3.</p>
<p>However, these stories unearth the biggest concerns regarding the institution of monarchy. Whereas it's mostly been tamed nowadays, in its core it remains outdated and illiberal. That's why it's so easy to revert to barbarism in all thing royal. As long as it exists, the nature of monarchism will tempt people into reactionary directions; this goes for both the kings and queens themselves (like our fasco-king Leopold III) and the Daily Mail-reading public.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we seem to have found the right way to deal with this. The way to contain the risks of monarchy isn't some kind of militant anti-royalism. That would grant to much importance to an institution that's already been successfully marginalised. No, the twitters are right: the perfect response is just to ridicule royalty.</p>
<p>Why? Let's use an analogy with another dangerous ancient institutions. The practice of duelling used to be widespread until the early nineteenth century. Back then a "real man" was expected to fall back on this violent tradition every time his "honour" was being threatened. In his 2011 book <em>The Better Angels of Our Nature</em> Stephen Pinker notes that while many governments tried to contain this problem by law, it never really went away. That is, until people in the mid-nineteenth century started making fun of this stupid tradition; within a generation no more duels were fought.</p>
<p>So as long as monarchies exist lets just pretend they're the sort of practical joke like the one against poor King Leo #1 that I described in the beginning. Let's just treat them like a big running joke, an endless reservoir of on- and offline laughter. Just don't let them in on it, we don't want to hurt their feelings.</p>
