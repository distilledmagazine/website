<p style="text-align: justify;">Recent events have caused the media to spend a lot of time talking about violence... in the media. How much of a role does <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/quentin-tarantino-newtown-violence-disrespectful_n_2408903.html">violence</a> play in the way our society lives, consumes, and defines itself? It seems like a fair question. But shouldn’t this dialogue be expanded to stereotypes in entertainment? Let’s give it a go and talk about bigotry in the media.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The U.S.-based Showtime series Homeland is widely acclaimed and just took home a whole <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Homeland">heap</a> of awards at both the Emmy’s and the Golden Globes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The show revolves around the interaction between the military intelligence powers that be (mostly the CIA, with some feckless interference from the FBI) and an American prisoner of war who has just been released after 10 years in an Al Qaeda prison.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here’s the catch: a rogue CIA operative has inside information that suggests the former Marine is now a jihadist. Over <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/showtime-chief-defends-homelands-second-411752">7.5 million</a> people viewed the Season 2 finale. The show is a smashing success.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, it is fictional. Yes, it is at times wildly unrealistic. But, it is based on many real-ish events (a real country, a real military-industrial big brother, and a real war). Part of what makes the show so captivating, is that it plays on the fears of the average white American. But doing so, it <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tvs_most_islamophobic_show">reinforces</a> the stereotypes faced by the average Muslim American.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Homeland’s world, there are multiple terrorist plots brewing all over America. Thank god the CIA is there with their illegal wiretaps and their plucky invasion of rights and privacy. Oh yeah, and every Muslim is connected, loosely or otherwise, to terrorists, terrorism, and the devastation of America.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are some aspects of the show and its writing that are fantastic, and that’s why the depiction of “Islam equals Terrorism” is so unfortunate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The portrayal of Sergeant Brody in his first days at home are gut-wrenching, and a painful reminder of the families that are too-often the urecognized casualties of war. Also, the show’s female lead Carrie, a CIA operative, struggles with an at-times debilitating mental illness that she has to hide from her colleagues in military intelligence. These characters are interesting and dynamic; if only all aspects of the show were crafted with such care.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/is-the-csi-effect-influencing-courtrooms">Empirical evidence</a> suggests that the general public can suspend disbelief or at least clearly delineate between entertainment and reality. But does that make it ok? Over ten years have passed since 9/11, but there’s still a lot of healing to be done at home and abroad. So a couple of questions for you, reader: Should the media hold themselves to a higher ethical standard? Am I overthinking this? Should I just sit back be entertained?</p>
