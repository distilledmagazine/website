<p style="text-align: justify;">Hey Sports Fans! I could spend this post telling you that the amount of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/super-bowl-ad-rates-can-double-within-ten-years">money spent</a> on the advertising alone yesterday is enough money to:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Send roughly 11,000 people to college.</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/10/world/africa/10aids.html?ref=africa">Treat</a> about 3.5 million people living with HIV/AIDS (or <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/essay_Green.html">prevent</a> upwards of 50 million cases)</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Or build a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/how-would-you-spend-350-million">commuter train</a> in a major metropolitan area.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But that would be depressing. You’re already feeling hungover, maybe you’re reevaluating some life choices, and you don’t really have time for all that heaviness right now. Well don’t ever let anyone say that I didn’t give the people what they <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/11064510">want</a>. And what is it that the people want? SEX IN ADVERTISING! Here’s a breakdown of three sex-laden Super Bowl ads that were (or weren’t) aired during big games past and present.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First up, we have this year’s smash hit from GoDaddy.com. Israeli supermodel Bar Refaeli makes out with an overweight, red-faced, nerd in the new “smart meets sexy” campaign.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column-->[youtube="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGJX6t3IAlk&amp;list=PLYghk91skLuP04dfxdZ68226zQG4Gm4Vg&amp;w=270]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apparently smart <em>and</em> sexy could never come in the same package, male or female. With an alleged 45 takes to get the final cut, I think we can all agree that girl earned every penny.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next up, a reject! Here’s one from the same sex dating site ManCrunch.com. In what was likely a publicity stunt (Man Crunch didn’t have the juice to pass the network-required credit check), two men realize they share a love of something other than sports. Amorous moments ensue. It’s a more tasteful rendition of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/6MPUySPKm50">Straight Dave</a>’s Man-Slamming Max-Out. Is this ad any different than the one above? No, but they were rejected before they even had a chance to play. Nerds getting laid? Affirmative. Gay boys? We’re not there yet, America.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The final, sexiest, and cutest is a throwback. In 2009, the one-and-only Pam Anderson shot a racy piece for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Isn’t she just the best? This one never made it to the air (all of PETA’s ads have been considered too hot for TV), but internet and social media have taken care of the distribution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ironically, the only ad that ran from the above list is by far the most <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/super-bowl-ads-racist-sexist-nerdy">misogynistic</a>. Bar Refaeli is 100% objectified (but doin’ it for the gold, so we’re OK with it). GoDaddy.com is by no means the biggest offender. This doesn’t scratch the surface of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ANhmS6QLd5Q">sexist</a>, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/9H0xPWAtaa8">racist</a>, and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/dxDSQ23cWhE" target="_blank">ill-conceived </a>ads that ran last night. And maybe a Super Bowl spot isn’t the best placement for a same sex dating site, but at <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/number-of-the-week-super-bowl-ads-cost-3-cents-per-viewer">$0.03 per viewer</a> that’s their choice. Or is it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All this spending on <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/super-bowl-ads-not-just-for-sports-fans">advertising</a> is pretty <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/?sf9197038=1">crazy</a>, honestly. Did you watch last night? Do you loooove the ads? Feel the need to defend them? Do it here!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This time, at least <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/super_bowl_ad_calls_for_strict.html" target="_blank">somebody</a> took a stand for something besides beer.</p>
