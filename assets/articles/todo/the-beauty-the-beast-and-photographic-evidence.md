<p>Many debates about the world of today centre on globalisation. But technologies going back to the Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries have had other effects besides connecting everyone through air travel and internet. The world  has also become a very visual place through photo and video imaging.</p>
<p>Not that it was un-visual before, as is shown by the immense production of paintings during the Dutch Golden Age or the drawings on Pompeian walls. But the immense increase in the quality, quantity and ‘flexibility’ of pictures has made it both possible and necessary to manage all this visual evidence.</p>
<p>Two recent cases are indicative of this. Firstly, Russian President Vladimir Putin <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/world-europe-19591179">admitted</a> that many of the pictures taken of him with wild animals were not genuine representations of the facts. The manipulation of photos is of course nothing new and it was already widely known in the western world that the photos of stuntman Putin were staged. Explaining the reasons for this forgery the President declared that he wanted to highlight the importance of Russia’s wildlife.</p>

<p>In contrast, 2500km away from Moscow <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/uk-19595221">anger arose</a> about certain pictures that were not omitted from print. The topless pictures of Duchess of Cambridge shook the United Kingdom as they reminded people of  <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/9752131.stm">Diana’s struggle</a> with French paparazzi. British media were quick to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/uk-19609184">declare</a> they would never publish something so distasteful, despite having themselves a rather doubtful reputation.</p>
<p>These events highlight the growing importance of visual representation in modern society.</p>
<p>But they also demonstrate the contrasting societies that surround this photographic evidence.</p>

<p>On the one hand too little liberty is tricky because it opens the possibility of manipulation. Although not yet at the level of the famous <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/legendaere-foto-manipulation-fahne-gefaelscht-uhr-versteckt-wolken-erfunden-a-551663.html">USSR modifications</a>, Putin is nevertheless capable of and willing to shape the way he is portrayed. To a certain extent all leaders and politicians do so, but it is symptomatic of current day Russia (and of the side effects of exporting certain western values) that he does it at this scale and can so easily hide behind ‘environmental concerns’.</p>
<p>On the other hand too much liberty also has its risks. The case of Kate and William is that of people who are no longer able to hide from the cameras. Admittedly they have a special relationship with the media because they are public figures, but they are nevertheless symbols of the growing problem everyone has in remaining invisible. The earlier photos of Prince Harry having a rather usual <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/uk-19346468">Las Vegas party</a> were in this sense very recognisable for partygoers around the world.</p>
<p>In both cases Buckingham Palace seems to have responded the right way. Harry could <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/uk-19472295">laugh</a> about his own mistake, and the Duke and Duchess will pursue <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/uk-19604535">legal action</a>.</p>
<p>So despite the still present dangers and pitfalls it is possible to draw a pretty optimistic conclusion, at least regarding the way photographic material is treated in Western Europe. Following a few scandals and clear breaches of privacy a certain vigilance seems to have been found. More debate is still necessary, but mostly to consolidate what has been achieved and to send a clear message to anyone who crosses the line.</p>
<p>In Russia however the revival of manipulation is worrisome. We already knew that Putin has his photos carefully managed but a new element is that he now openly admits it. This implies that he does not care about the fact that it might give the opposition more ammunition. It is a clear message to both the west and the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/world-europe-18405306">thousands</a> gathered in Moscow that protesting will not help as he is even strong enough to admit that he is in control over what is true or not.</p>
