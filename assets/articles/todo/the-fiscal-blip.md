<p style="text-align: justify;">The Fiscal Cliff — better known to the American media as the end of civilization — has been front and center for President Obama since taking office. The strange thing, though, is that the Fiscal Cliff isn’t real. At least it's not a real problem that came up that we need to address as a society.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those of you not entirely familiar with American politics, and the fabricated drama that is the Fiscal Cliff, allow us to go back a step or two. In 2001 and 2003 President George W. Bush enacted a huge series of tax cuts. These cuts helped the middle and working classes a bit, but were an even bigger boon for the richest 1%, the Rockefellers of this country. Combine these huge revenue cuts with a couple of wars in the Middle East, and you start to rack up quite a credit card bill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the beginning of 2013 these tax cuts expire. Congress has named this deadline "The Fiscal Cliff". This suggests that it would be so awful, so sinister, that Republicans and Democrats would have to come to an agreement  before we reach it. Falling off “the cliff” would automatically raise taxes on all income levels, and entail steep spending cuts in defense, benefits, and other government programs.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, President Obama is left holding the bag. It’s true, the United States does have a significant amount of debt.  But this does not mean that the economy is in shambles, or that the government needs to implement huge cuts to social programs. It has created a political fiasco though. That cannot be ignored.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But heres the good news. There are clear paths out of this financial dilemma. Some of them are much more palatable than others. There are three overarching ideologies currently being peddled by politicos and thinkers around Washington D.C.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Republicans want the little guy to take one on the chin for corporate America and the 1%, by cutting benefits programs such as Social Security and Medicare.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Obama though wants the Rockefeller types to pay up. But only a bit, and the little guy gets to sacrifice a bit too for posterity. That would seem like a win on the surface, but in fact still be a significant loss.  In exchange for a slight increase on top tax rates, Obama would concede significant cuts to social safety nets. This would be detrimental to both working families and the economy as a whole.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The third option is that we actually make the people who have been getting a free ride for years pay. This means cutting things like corporate welfare (e.g. subsidies to oil companies) and the bloated defense budget, while increasing taxes on higher income earners. Call it respecting the Social Contract.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Fiscal Cliff is really just political theater. We should be discussing the immense problems facing us. Climate change? The wealth gap? But our elected officials prefer to bicker over whether the rich should pay a dime in more taxes. This is not progress.</p>
