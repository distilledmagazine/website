<p class="break"><strong>Acting as the Cradle of Civilization: Iranian Ambassador Barimani discusses WMDs</strong></p>
<p class="break"><em>On Monday 6 May, the University of Leuven hosted an honoured guest. His excellency Mahmoud Barimani, extraordinary and plenipotentiary Ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the European Union, Belgium and Luxemburg, agreed to speak to the Academic community in the renowned ‘Ambassador’s lecture series’. And he did not visit in order to avoid the difficult topics: with a lecture on Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) in the Middle-East, Barimani certainly moved into treacherous waters. To see whether he would sink or swim, Distilled Magazine made sure to send an envoy of its own.</em></p>

<p class="break">In order to give the audience a reminder of how complex and sensitive the problem of WMDs in the Middle East exactly is, Professor Luc Reychler, director of the Center for Peace Research and Strategic Studies, was allowed to set the stage. Opening with a rather general summary of the official Iranian position on WMDs (“We do not have them, do not want them, and prefer them banned”) and the historical development of the country’s nuclear aspirations, Reychler quickly turned to the core of the issue. After stating that “the Middle Eastern crisis is potentially, no, is very dangerous” he identified 5 central threads that make up the current crisis. The first four included the old and current history of the Middle-East, the increased foreign intervention (including state-sponsored terrorism), the use of coercive diplomacy, and the dogma of offensive dominance, a concept which he qualified as ‘rare, overrated and dangerous’ but is a principle guide for Israeli foreign policy.</p>
<p class="break">After summarily discussing these elements Reychler swiftly moved to the centrepiece of his introduction, build upon a fifth threat: distorted and dangerous communication. According to the professor, the use of coercive diplomacy and increased interventionism have resulted in a soiled diplomatic language and even the regular breakdown of communications. Not without any pathos, the Leuven professor warned for the coming storm: only with an immediate and radical shift in strategy, future war can be prevented. Starting point for such a strategy would be, besides more Western restraint regarding its interventions, the abandonment of coercive diplomacy and the resumption of official US-Iran relations.</p>
<p class="break">So with Barimani next on stage, this conclusion seemed like an immediate invitation: could the Ambassador take up the gauntlet and moderate his own language?</p>
<p class="break">As could be expected however, Barimani remained solidly fixed in his role as a representative. After opening the lecture in the name of Allah, his first remark reminded the audience of Persia’s role as the cradle of science and civilization. At that point this might have still looked like a promotional reference to a knowledgeable audience, but it soon proved to be a more structural feature in the Iranian exposé. Throughout his talk, the Ambassador explicitly attempted to keep his feet on the moral high ground.</p>
<p class="break">Conform to the official language of the Iranian government, Barimani’s first goal was to portray Iran as a reliable international partner. “Iran”, so he stated, “is the only country in the Middle-East with popular democracy and universal suffrage. Combined with its position as a stable force in the region, this has been enough reason for the West to invite the Islamic Republic to participate in the state-building processes of two of its war-struck neighbours.”</p>
<p class="break">Continuing along this line, the Ambassador repeated Iran’s WMD-policy as already expounded by Reychler: “Iran considers peace and security vital to democracy and development. We want nuclear power for everyone, and nuclear weapons for no one”. In one of the many and deliberate moments of irony in his talk, Barimani demanded that the nuclear powers would “take immediate and verifiable measures” to abide by the Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaties (NPT) and other disarmament agreements. But cutting the irony, the representative did not hesitate to make direct accusations either.</p>
<p class="break">The main sore point proved to be the agreement of 2010, reached within the context of the NPT review sessions. During this review Iran had consented to discussions about the creation of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle-East, set to be held in 2012. Unfortunately, the US and Israel later decided to unilaterally and indefinitely postpone these talks. Clear evidence to Barimani that Israel is bent on keeping its strategic dominance. This concrete complaint was followed by more traditional accusations, such as the claim that Israel spends 10% of its GDP on military assets and has about 200 illegal nuclear warheads without facing any consequences, whereas Iran is punished for spending only 3% on its armed forces and abiding by all NPT regulations.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_5578" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Arak-plant.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5578" alt="Arak plant (Source: Wikimedia Commons http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Arak_Heavy_Water4.JPG)" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Arak-plant-300x223.jpg" width="300" height="223" /></a> Arak plant (Source: Wikimedia Commons)[/caption]</p>
<p class="break">At this point the Ambassador also halted a moment to invite the audience to reflect on the double standards applied by the West, a theme indeed happily picked up during the Q&amp;A. Most memorable were the strategic suggestions made by one member of the audience, who recommended that Iran should ignore the American puppet Catherine Ashton, negotiate directly with the individual European countries to stay neutral, close the Strait of Hormuz and watch the US crumble under the dollar crisis. This way Israel would stand alone, and be no match for the full weight of Iranian military might. There was unfortunately no sense of irony this comment.</p>
<p class="break">After his invitation to inquire about this during the questions session, Barimani quickly turned to his main theme of turning the tables on Israel and the US. Slowly reaching his climax, and touching upon some actual stronger arguments, the Ambassador moved to the stability of the region as a whole. Peace and stability might be hard to reach with a “massive nuclear arsenal” in the region, and Israel’s decision to ignore the IAEA and the NPT has opened the door to more non-compliance by other states. Not without reason he mentioned that the great powers should pay more attention to the calls of the wider international community. In any case, the Iranian spokesmen hoped that the 2015 NPT review conference might create the necessary momentum to do so.</p>
<p class="break">So what could be learned from this lecture by a central representative of Iran’s policy? Unfortunately, only that he reinforced the core arguments of the academic who introduced him. The Ambassador merely demonstrated the problem of talking through accusations. On the grounds of the official Iranian position, no improvement in the WMD-crisis of the Middle-East is to be expected. It therefore comes to no surprise that, just as in Reychler’s introduction, the final words of the Ambassador’s presentation were a plain warning: “A spark is sufficient to make the region explode. We need to work together now, as a true Cradle of Civilisation.”</p>

<p class="break"><strong>Iran: IAEA Board of Governors Report</strong></p>
<p class="break">As recent as last February, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of the United Nations drafted a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/gov2013-6.pdf">new summary</a> regarding the nuclear energy situation within the Islamic Republic of Iran. Topic of the report, which was released on March 6th, was Iran’s implementation of the safeguard provisions of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the UN resolutions concerning its nuclear programme. As the assessments of the IAEA determine to a large extent how this programme is perceived by the international community, it becomes interesting to have a closer look to the report itself. After all, as an earlier WMD-farce constituted the overture to the Iraq war of 2003, independent information is an invaluable requirement to place the Middle-Eastern tensions in their correct light.</p>
<p class="break">Not surprisingly then, the first and foremost problem of the Iranian nuclear programme is exactly its reluctance to provide full information to the IAEA. Despite Teheran’s claims of full adherence to the NPT and other demands of the international community, there has been a notorious lack of cooperation with the agency during the last decade. This implies immediate concerns about its objectives. As the Agency summarized the problem in its introduction to the report: ‘full implementation of [its] obligations is needed to establish international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme’.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_5570" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IAEA-headquarters.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5570" alt="IAEA headquarters (Source: Wikimedia Commons)" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IAEA-headquarters-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a> IAEA headquarters (Source: Wikimedia Commons)[/caption]</p>
<p class="break">In order to settle the outstanding issues, the IAEA adopted a new (and binding) resolution in November 2011, “which, inter alia, it stressed that it was essential for Iran and the Agency to intensify their dialogue aimed at the urgent resolution of all outstanding substantive issues.” In order to achieve this objective, the Agency and the Islamic Republic held six rounds of talks in Vienna and Teheran, including a visit by the IAEA director general to the Iranian capital in May 2012. “However”, the report states, “no concrete results were achieved.” The only concrete step the Agency could take was to immediately adopt a new resolution after the breakdown, urging Iran that a first step in recovering international confidence is to provide access to some undisclosed sites. Equally, further steps to draft a “structures approach document” with the Iranian officials faltered.</p>
<p class="break">Besides the failed dialogue, Iran failed to comply with the IAEA on a number of issues, most famously its nuclear enrichment programme. “Contrary to the relevant resolutions of the Board of Governors and the Security Council, Iran has not suspended its enrichment related activities in the declared facilities referred to below.” Centrally, enrichment in Nataz and Fordow has continued, ignoring the UN and IAEA resolutions demanding otherwise. Nevertheless, the Agency has access to these sites and confirms that no other activities take place than those that were declared by Iran. Concerning other activities related to nuclear development, such as nuclear reproduction processes or the production of heavy water, the result is equally mixed. Iran does not abide by the demands of the resolutions, but most of what they do is monitored.</p>
<p class="break">Clue is of course the word ‘most’. Discussing the potential military dimensions of the Iranian nuclear enrichment, the report clearly states that 3Since 2002, the Agency has become increasingly concerned about the possible existence in Iran of undisclosed nuclear related activities involving military related organizations, including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile. Iran has dismissed the Agency’s concerns, largely on the grounds that Iran considers them to be based on unfounded allegations.” Confirming a report drafted earlier in 2011, there has been increasing evidence that Iran continues to take steps relevant to the creation of a nuclear weapon, and it has refused to provide clarification about these actions.</p>
<p class="break">Of even greater importance was the discovery in March 2011 of a “large explosion containment vessel” in Parchin, which could be used for hydrodynamic experiments. According to the IAEA, “such experiments would be strong indicators of possible nuclear weapon development.” As a consequence, the Agency rechecked satellite imagery from 2005 until 2012. Crucially, it monitored no significant activity around the building until the moment the Iranian government was confronted with a request for access to the site. From that point onwards, Iran made significant alterations to the site. The result of this work is that “when the Agency gains access to the location, its ability to conduct effective verification will have been seriously undermined.”</p>
<p class="break">In response, the Iranian government produced a letter in which it stated that the allegation of nuclear activities at Parchin are “baseless” and that “the recent activities claimed to be conducted in the vicinity of the location of interest to the Agency, has nothing to do with specified location by the Agency.” Most famously, Teheran declared that much of the observed activity was “due to constructing the Parchin new road.” But the timing of events and the strange and uncompromising responses of Iran clearly warrant suspicion. Although not explicit, the tone of the IAEA report implies that this site very much looks like a threat. Unfortunately, absolute proof of nuclear activity hasn’t been delivered yet.</p>
<p class="break">This increasingly seems to become the central problem of the Iranian claims. The more their assertion of reliability clashes with the reality of non-information, the more they put themselves on the international side-line, which in turn creates more distrust. As a final remark, the IAEA stated that “given the nature and extent of credible information available, the Agency continues to consider it essential for Iran to engage with the Agency without further delay on the substance of the Agency’s concerns. In the absence of such engagement, the Agency will not be able to resolve concerns about issues regarding the Iranian nuclear programme, including those which need to be clarified to exclude the existence of possible military dimensions to Iran’s nuclear programme."</p>
