<p><em>How does the US monitor its immigration flow and does this system need an update? Sara Cosemans is a graduate student at Columbia and argues for a revision of the colour line.</em></p>
<p class="break"><strong>Immigration in the USA: the story of a persistent myth</strong></p>
<p class="break">Using ‘immigration’ and ‘USA’ in a sentence almost seems like a pleonasm. Per definition, the United States of America is society constituted by migrants. Migration to the United States is a well-documented phenomenon, resulting in an endless stream of data about the composition of the always-growing migrant population. However neutral the percentages, maps, and graphs may seem, a closer look reveals that the categories of classification are ambiguous, to say the least. This is especially apparent with regard to the racial composition of “foreign born.”</p>
<p class="break">[caption id="attachment_5333" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ellis_island_1902.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5333" alt="Ellis Island, 1902 (Wikimedia Commons)" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ellis_island_1902-300x203.jpg" width="300" height="203" /></a> Ellis Island, 1902 (Wikimedia Commons)[/caption]</p>
<p class="break">The Census Bureau differentiates between three main races (“white”, “black”, and “Asian”) and allows for some deviation by creating the categories of “others” and people with more than one racial background.<a title="" href="#_edn1">[i]</a> In the 2009 census, 48.9% of the immigrants reported to be white, 8.2% black or African American, 23.9% Asian, 17.5% others and 1.7% as having two or more races. Hispanics and Latinos are not a racial category, but include the people who categorized themselves as Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino.<a title="" href="#_edn2">[ii]</a> However, this does not mean that they are not counted separately. In 2009, 46.9% of all foreign-born USA inhabitants reported to be “Hispanic” and as much as 29.8% of the entire migrant population was Mexican. The percentage of Hispanic people in each racial category (presumably white, black and other) is unknown. However, given the proximity of the percentage of white immigrants and Hispanic immigrants one can assume that most Hispanics are identified as white in the census.</p>
<p class="break">What does this mean? In a highly racial categorized society, “Hispanic” people clearly confuse the colour line. Not a race on their own, but large enough a group to be counted separately they fall between two chairs. But there is more to it than simply that. One does only need to walk through Spanish Harlem to note that “Hispanics” are not treated as white (<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/stop-and-frisk-practices">racial profiling</a> is a big deal in New York). Ask the delivery guy on his bicycle if he has ever faced racial discrimination and he will most certainly answer he has. Where does this schizophrenic situation stem from? It seems as if the USA in categorizing her migrants tries to keep the number of “white” migrants artificially high. (To be clear, the flaw lies not in the fact that some “Hispanics” identify themselves as “whites” and others as “blacks” but in the system of categorization that cannot decide whether to treat the “Hispanics” as a racial group or not).</p>
<p class="break">Underlying this phenomenon is the persistent myth that the USA from the start was predominantly a white settler’s colony. Adam McKeown, at the History Department of Columbia University, was the first to debunk that myth in the light of global migration:</p>
<p class="break">“Most histories have recounted the age of mass migration as a transatlantic phenomenon. When migrations beyond the Atlantic are remembered at all, it is usually as a limited number of indentured laborers pressed into the service of Europeans. This historical memory is not random. It is the foundation of the broadest global identities: East and West, North and South, First and Third Worlds; and the liberal and illiberal regions of the modern international system.”<a title="" href="#_edn3">[iii]</a></p>
<p class="break">McKeown proves that Asians were as mobile as European, organized in similar networks, and equal in numbers in 1840. But the end of the century, their numbers had dropped drastically due to migration control: “Mechanisms to control Asian mobility gave concrete enforcement to the images and ideologies of difference that had inspired those controls in the first place. These images of a backward, immobile Asia helped erase Asian migrations from the historical memory and still shape understandings of Asian migration to this day.”<a title="" href="#_edn4">[iv]</a> The distorted view on migration and the distorted historical memory does, however, not only affect the Asians today, but also other migrant groups, especially when their “colour” is hard to define.</p>
<p class="break">Immigration and border control continue to provoke much debate in the United States. The legacy of immigration is highly interwoven with the white settlers’ myth and the belief that “white” immigration is preferred in order to keep the society operative. However, not all “white” migrants have the same value beyond the migration records. This has led to a strange paradox in the American society. The country hosts people from all over the world, only to subsequently forget who they are, divide them into “racial” categories, and treat them according to the colour of their skin. Meanwhile, on paper, the United States remains “white”.</p>
<p class="break">In 1903, the American scholar, writer, and human rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois predicted that the most important problem of the twentieth century would be that of the colour line.<a title="" href="#_edn5">[v]</a> As an African American, he clearly referred to the rights of the freedman in the United States and the inability of the society to treat black and white men equally as men.<a title="" href="#_edn6">[vi]</a> In the beginning of the twenty-first century, the colour palette has become more diverse than ever and “brown” people who do not exactly seem to fit in any category confuse the colour line. It is time to question again the categories that still divide on basis of skin. In an increasingly globalizing world, it is time for a paradigm shift in which each migrant’s legacy is recognized and colour is not the main parameter for categorization.</p>

<p><a title="" href="#_ednref1">[i]</a> Though the concept of race as used by the Census Bureau reflects self-identification by people according to the race or races with which they most closely identify, we must keep in mind that bureaucrats and immigration officers created these categories, which are thus not neutral.</p>

<p>[tab_item title="Interview"]</p>
<p><em>Flavia de la Fuente and Juan Escalante are both involved with immigrant advocacy and policy reform. So in order to get an inside perspective, Distilled Extra wondered what would happen if one interviewed the other<br />
</em></p>
<p class="break">Hello, Distilled readers! My name is Flavia de la Fuente, and today I’ll be interviewing Juan Escalante. You should Google him. Anyways, Juan and I met on the internet on March 1st, 2010 when I joined DreamActivist as the editor. We discovered we both have a mutual love for Star Wars. He made a "that's what she said' joke. I asked him whether gators are really everywhere in Florida. And since that day we have met in person exactly once, and yet we are best buddies.</p>
<p class="break"><strong>Hey Juan. What’s up?</strong></p>
<p class="break">Not much, you know... wondering why am I being interviewed like this. Are you teaching me? Are you trying to expand my creative juices? Is this a way for you to teach me? Are you a teacher? OMG, I suck don’t I? I knew it, I let this sit too long and now you think I suck. SIGH...</p>
<p class="break"><strong>So. You’re undocumazing. I mean undocumented. How did that happen?</strong></p>
<p class="break">Well, it’s kind of a funny story. My parents applied for a professional visa, an L1, which provided a passage to become a Legal Permanent Resident (LPR, and eventually a citizen. We arrived in the United States on August 29th, 2000 and after six years of paperwork, litigation, application fees, lawyer fees, and waiting in the so called “line” that all immigrants are expected to wait in, we came to the realization that our lawyer filed the wrong paperwork at the wrong time. All those years, and all that effort - wasted. Our case was closed by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), with no appeal.</p>
<p class="break">When people ask me about my immigration status, when they hear this story, they often respond “Oh wow, so you are not like those other border crossers who come mooch off our county!” I don’t respond, rather I stay silent - because rather than bury the ignorance with my fact checked knowledge, I rather just convince myself that I ought to work even harder to achieve a comprehensive reform to our current immigration system.</p>
<p class="break"><strong>What are some typical situations in which your undocumented status has interfered with living a normal life?</strong></p>
<p class="break">[caption id="attachment_5336" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/US-border-notice.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5336" alt="US border notice (Wikimedia Commons" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/US-border-notice-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a> US border notice (Wikimedia Commons[/caption]</p>
<p class="break">I would say driving and working are two big issues in my life, or were, now that I have been granted Deferred Action. Florida is a very special state, in the sense that if you don’t have a car - then you have no way of getting around, and much less means of making money; unless you work from home of course. Out of the gate that makes things difficult on you, meaning that you have to take a blind risk when going to school, the grocery store, or when meeting up with you friends. Then there is the fear that should you be OK driving around without the proper documentation, that one of your family members, say one of your parents, will not be so lucky and land themselves in a detention facility because they need to drive on a regular basis as part of their backbreaking work.</p>
<p class="break">Just that alone, couple with the fact that you are always asked to show ID, are unable to travel, have always to explain your dates why they have to drive, all of it sums up to immense amounts of pressure that make you wonder if any of the things you do are worth your time.</p>
<p class="break"><strong>And when did things change for you to become so involved with these problems?<br />
</strong></p>
<p class="break">I think that was when I went to DC for the first time to meet the DreamActivist.org crew. Up until that point it was all about me trying to go and get the Dream Act passed as soon as possible in order to go to college with my friends from high school. Once I saw how many people were involved, how many stories there were - I just never really stopped to think about how big the issue really was, and how it affected every single person differently. That is when I knew that it was not just about me: it was about all of us!</p>
<p class="break"><strong>So Juan - tell us about the cool cats you roll with. NIYA (National Immigrant Youth Alliance). Are they totally nutso? What does it do? How is it different from other organizations?</strong></p>
<p class="break">I wouldn’t say I ‘hang” with anybody - I mean, I interact with them on a daily basis; but, on a digital manner. You have to understand that most of the people who I “work” with are out in various states across the United States. Due to our undocumented status, many of us were unable or unwilling to travel during most of the time we have been working on the issue. Whether it was due to fear, work, or personal finance, most us base our connections via text messages, Facebook, or GChats (you know this more than anyone Flavia).</p>
<p class="break">Knowing all of that - I will say that in my free time from work, I did venture to places that I would not have otherwise visited, were it not for the immigrant rights movement. Washington DC, Atlanta, Detroit, etc. all due to organize in those respective communities. And yes, I have met some incredible folks along the way, some I have only met once, others I see once a year or so. Many of these individuals are some of the bravest, smartest, and most selfless people I have met. Yeah, we don’t always look eye to eye, perhaps with one another or with organization nationwide, but at the end of the day many of the folks that compose the NIYA are cutthroat activists who are willing and ready to fight for what is right and just.</p>
<p class="break"><strong>What has been the most empowering moment so far of working as an activist on immigration?</strong></p>
<p class="break">I think that traveling to Washington D.C. in 2009 to meet with the DreamActivist.org team has been one of the most wonderful, and empowering experiences I’ve had to date. I say that because it wasn't the average trip to meet with “some friends” to do the traditional student lobby on the US Capitol. Here I was, a freshman in college who had been working on the Dream Act issue for a little over a year, with complete strangers over the internet, and now I was booking a flight to meet those same “strangers”, room with them, and consult with them on how we would push the Dream Act forth.</p>
<p class="break">This was an important moment for me. I had shed a majority of my fear, and committed to help a movement that I saw was “bigger than myself” - I’m glad I took that first step all those years ago, I can’t say I would be where I am today without haven't made those decisions</p>
