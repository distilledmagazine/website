<p dir="ltr">In early April 2012, I took an overnight train from <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kayseri">Kayseri</a> to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Adana">Adana</a> in southeast Turkey.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kayseri is a conservative commercial sprawl plopped in the center of Anatolia. It was a tough place to get a drink, but a safe place to walk around at night. Adana is different: warm and spicy like the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Adana_kebab">eponymous kebabs</a>, and looser too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I spent the night trying to sleep while sitting upright in my chair. The shoulder of the elderly man to my right served as the occasional pillow to slobber on.</p>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">When I arrived in Adana, I was shocked by the palm trees and sunshine after having endured the snows and bitter cold of Anatolia in only a light jacket I “borrowed.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">I also received another shock when I picked up a newspaper just outside the train station. <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kofi_Annan">Kofi Annan</a> was visiting the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Reyhanl%C4%B1">Reyhanlı</a> refugee camp near the Syrian border the next day.</p>
<p><b><b> <img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Map_of_Turkey_%282007%29.gif" width="634" height="324" /></b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">In the months leading up to my journey alone through Turkey, I had begun to waver -- when I stood on firm ground I felt a wobble in my stomach, and when I stood on tremors I swayed with the beat.</p>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">I decided to go to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Antakya">Antakya</a>, the largest city near the Syrian border, Antioch of antiquity (where followers of Christianity were first called "Christians"), and only a stone's throw away from Reyhanlı. After lunch in the city center, I found a driver to take me to the <em>otogar</em> on the other side of town, where I would then hitch a bus to Antakya. I was soon drinking tea with my bus driver as we waited for our departure time.</p>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">The landscape shifted from scrubby brushland to Mediterranean vineyards and olive trees, dotting the ridges and crowding the shorelines. It was hot on the bus, a relatively new experience that put me to sleep only an hour into the trip. When I woke up, we were near Antakya, and approaching the suburban shopping mall where I would take a city bus into the center of town.</p>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">When I finally arrived in Antakya, I was struck by how different it was from the rest of Turkey. There were still portraits of Attaturk on public buildings, still ubiquitous kebab stands and pastry shops. What was different was the language and the music, a sense that we were now far closer spiritually to the Arab world than to Istanbul.</p>
<p><b><b><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/319832_10100227277900189_536984062_n.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5523" alt="319832_10100227277900189_536984062_n" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/319832_10100227277900189_536984062_n.jpg" width="604" height="453" /></a></b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">I’ve never been to Syria, and this was as close as I have gotten. But there was a lot of Syria (and Lebanon, and Iraq, and Kurdistan) in Antakya and the Hatay province. There was even the proliferation of religions that characterize Syria (and, sadly, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Syrian_civil_war">the civil war</a> as well). Mosques, Catholic churches, synagogues, even a Russian Orthodox church.</p>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">Saturday, two car bombs in the border town of Reyhanlı <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/world/middleeast/9-detained-in-bombings-on-turkey-border-with-syria.html">killed 46 people.</a> Yesterday, nine Turkish citizens were arrested in connection with the bombings, and are believed to have ties to the Syrian intelligence agency, according to Turkish officials.</p>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">For some time, the concern on Turkey’s part has been spillover violence due to the instability of the bordering Syrian regime. During the 1990s, Syria provided safe haven to Kurdish rebels associated with the terrorist arm of the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Pkk">PKK</a>. Many in Turkey’s ruling <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey)">Justice and Development Party (AKP) </a>were forged in the crucible of the “Kurdish problem”, and are therefore wary of Syria, despite a recent rapprochement with the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Bashar_Al-Assad">Bashar Al-Assad</a> regime that led to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/110815A.html">visa-free cross-border travel</a> as recently as 2010.</p>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">The border near Reyhanli has been the site of one of the largest <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/taking-refuge-syrian-revolution-in-turkey">refugee camps</a> produced by the Syrian civil war, with over 200,000 refugees. It has also become increasingly clear that this border area has been a safe haven for the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Free_Syrian_Army">Free Syrian Army</a> and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Local_Coordination_Committees">Local Coordination Committees</a> – some of the many rebel groups fighting Assad and others within Syria.</p>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">It has been two years now since the first uprising began in Syria. <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Syrian_Observatory_for_Human_Rights">The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights</a>, based in the UK, has estimated that more than 80,000 people have died during that time. And it doesn’t seem like the war will end anytime soon.</p>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">Is there anything we can do? Of the various options available to the international community, most are impractical, if not completely untenable. A fundamental problem with the war is that it is far from clear whom we would help, how we would do it, or what the outcome would be once Assad fell. Iraq and Afghanistan have taught the international community valuable lessons on the impact of intervention. Perhaps more importantly, it is a challenge for any party to make sense of what is happening in Syria.</p>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">And that is what bothers me: sense. War occupies a territory in the human heart and soul that reason and sense have vacated. In much the same way the machinations we devise to ensure the trains run on time and store shelves are full of milk and bread also ensure that war, once ignited, cannot truly be extinguished. War consumes, but leaves nothing behind (save for the records of lives lived that can never be restored, courtesy of several brave journalists and photographers).</p>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">We often think of diplomacy as the rational back and forth of reason between informed parties. Even respected foreign policy scholars have become enamored with applying “game theory” to diplomatics. But the mayhem in Syria doesn’t seem to be subject to reason, and it seems likely that even if Assad were to fall, the war would continue apace. We could say it’s the pursuit of revenge. Power. Wealth. But it’s none of these things. Of the many lessons of the Holocaust and the many other horrors that have occurred since the last time the world was lit on fire, there is no real reason or motivation involved. There is no meaning in war.</p>
<p><b><b> All I saw was a single society with war on one side of a ridge and peace on the other, and not a single damn reason as to why.</b></b></p>

<p dir="ltr">The first thing I did when I finally arrived at the banks of the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Orontes_river">Orontes</a>, a river I had read about so many times in my history books as a teenager, I sought out a pastry shop I had heard about from my driver in Adana. I wanted to try the Antakyan variant of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/K%C3%BCnefe">Künefe</a>, a hot sweet cheese pastry the city was famous for.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/574812_10100227276263469_965862222_n.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5524" alt="574812_10100227276263469_965862222_n" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/574812_10100227276263469_965862222_n.jpg" width="453" height="604" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">While I chowed down on my pastry, I chatted with the owner who was curious as to how I heard about the place. Outside, the local police were having a fundraiser, and several of the policemen were playing in a band.  Across from them hung a large banner of Attaturk over the city hall, and across the banks of the river was the towering minaret of the Ulu Mosque. There were children dancing, and elderly grandpas dancing with them to the policemen’s music.</p>
<p><b><b><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/545653_10100227278029929_1657776706_n.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5525" alt="545653_10100227278029929_1657776706_n" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/545653_10100227278029929_1657776706_n.jpg" width="604" height="453" /></a></b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">And over the ridge that separated Antakya from the border region rose a large plume of thick black smoke.</p>
