excerpt: Modern increases in productivity should mean that we can work fewer hours,
  but that has turned out not to be the case. Sarang Shah describes the fruits of
  idleness that become available with more time away from work.

<p>What if I told you we'd be much better off with only working 20 hours a week? And that we'd be just as content with our material well-being as we are now?</p>
<p>Crazy talk, you say? An idea borne of madness?</p>
<p>Well, suffice it to say, it's been quite some time since I've huffed that <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Death_in_Venice">old Mediterranean sirocco</a>. And I'm not the first to propose such an idea -- philosopher <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Bertrand_Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> (better known perhaps for his <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Principia_Mathematica">mathematical prowess</a>) proposed just such an idea decades ago. Published in 1932, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/idle.html">"In Praise of Idleness"</a> is a casual discussion about the virtues of working far less, written at the height of Bolshevism's ascendancy in both Europe and America.</p>
<p>Russell argues that we can produce enough to sustain human life comfortably in Western industrialized nations with only half the number of working hours on average we currently devote to the punch-in/punch-out box. Since 1932, Russell's basic argument has only gained in credibility: technology has now allowed workers to be far more productive than any victim of the Great Depression could ever imagine. Rather counter-intuitively, the rise in productivity has also paralleled a rise in working hours.</p>
<p>So what does all this increased productivity yield us? A decline in poverty? A rise in material comfort to rival that of any Renaissance king or queen for every individual?</p>
<p>Surprisingly, no. Living standards have certainly risen for many individuals, but income inequality has also risen. That means that many of the gains in productivity have benefited an ever wealthier upper class. The flip side of the coin is that poverty has also deepened, and chronic unemployment remains the greatest humanitarian crisis the West has seen in decades. If we can make a lot more, while also putting a lot more work in, what gives?</p>
<p>Simple: income inequality means that we don't make as much as we should per hour. That leads to working longer hours, which in turn generates ever greater profit for the wealthy at the top, and far less for those in the middle and bottom. The tired working classes then retire to their homes, where they are far too exhausted to engage in civic life. Meanwhile, those at the top sell the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4.html">poor, tired, huddled masses </a>material goods <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/state-of-the-middle-class/">with the promise</a> that these goods will deliver the satisfaction and happiness they need. People, as Russell <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/idle.html">points out</a>, veer toward passive rather than active activities such as watching TV:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The pleasures of urban populations have become mainly passive: seeing cinemas, watching football matches, listening to the radio, and so on. This results from the fact that their active energies are fully taken up with work; if they had more leisure, they would again enjoy pleasures in which they took an active part."</p></blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day, the people who would benefit most from challenging the status quo are the least likely to incite change. And as we have seen since 2008, modern finance has only served to accelerate this vicious cycle.</p>
<p>The result is even greater income inequality and a growing resentment, crystallizing into hatred, shacking up in the psyche of the global middle class.</p>
<p>What would be the benefits of a four hour workday? The greatest benefit would be more time afforded to people to pursue the production of other, less tangible goods necessary for the "good life." What are these? The raising of well-cared for, loved children (human capital and labor). Education. The opportunity to make and create things, and the joy that comes from it. Self-education through the pursuit of varied experiences. Scientific and intellectual advancement (would Einstein have developed relativity were his job at the patent office much more strenuous?).</p>
<p>In short, empathy. Idleness, as defined by Russell, generates empathy.</p>
<p>Not that these things cannot be produced through work. It just remains a rather sad fact of contemporary life that most work is not conducive to personal -- and often even professional -- development, leaving the opportunity to develop fully within the ever-declining hours left to leisure.</p>
<p>So, how do we get to this wondrous four hour workday?</p>
<p>It won't be easy. Our cultural fabric in the West places a heavy shame on those who do not compete with their neighbors for bigger, shinier things -- a competition well suited to the demands of late capitalism. Similarly, competition drives corporations to pursue growth rather than stasis (<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/1">as pointed out by Felix Salmon</a>), even though the pursuit of growth <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/the-financial-crisis-of-shareholder-primacy/">for the sake of shareholders</a> is often destructively destabilizing. This incentive structure -- also responsible for <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/book-review-twilight-of-the-elites-by-chris-hayes/">the Iron Law of Oligarchy </a>that weakens a meritocracy -- can only be diminished by creating empathy as the foundation of human interaction, and not economic transaction. That empathy could be generated through greater leisure time.</p>
<p>We like new things, and new things require an investment of effort and work beyond what is necessary to maintain the status quo. Likewise, when disaster strikes, we would need to work more hours to rebuild what was destroyed (and oh how having to work more would change the calculus of going to war, as Russell astutely notes). But the obvious rejoinder would be: "Can we not use the remaining time we have carved out for ourselves for leisure to create new things?"</p>
<p>Yes, we can!</p>
<p>What does the future look like, then? Just like the 8 hour work day, the minimum wage, and the end of child labor were hard fought gains of the labor movement and not part of any "natural order", so would a four hour work day have to be won through a cultural shift in public opinion and through political organizing. France, for instance, has a cultural reference of a 35 hour work week, so it is certainly feasible to achieve this shift. That cultural shift would also require that people recognize time and personal enrichment to be as precious as money.</p>
<p>How do we get to this future?</p>
<p>We need a basic conversation in society about these  and other fundamental assumptions about how we live our lives. Unfortunately, to project the voice required to start that conversation requires power, and power currently resides within those for whom a change in the status quo would be unacceptable. The only thing that would begin to ignite the conversation is <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/thought-from-john-maynard-keynes.html">to move that mental block </a>in people's minds against such an idea. And once moved, people must have a social forum in which they would feel comfortable talking about these issues, and then acting on them. Only through this honest conversation can a massive shift in the way we live our lives take place.</p>
