<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Normally Valentine’s Day represents little more than candy hearts, a greeting card, and musty flowers. This year, let us shift the focus to creative passion in all things. Not just the love we experience between people, but the inspiration that comes from some greater, societal mandate.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Valentine’s Day is apt for all kinds romantic ruminations - romantic love, filial love, and so on and so forth. But what about the love of something greater, a dream?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Aaron Swartz lived by ideals that trumped all of the former, more human, kinds of love. By now, many of you know the story of an intrepid young programmer wise beyond his years but idealistic to a fault. If you don’t, look <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aaron_swartz_memorial_service_demonstrates_the_battle_for_his_legacy.html">here</a> and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aaron-swartz-2013-2">here</a>, or listen to his friend Lawrence Lessig in the video. These people expound on the life of Aaron Swartz in ways that are thorough and compassionate.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Swartz’s life is not terribly dissimilar from that of Saint Valentine. Valentine was praised throughout Italy, especially in Umbria, for his progressivism. But Saint Valentine was also <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/main.php?cat_id=403&amp;id_dett=156">tortured</a> ruthlessly by a tyrant who didn’t believe in the tenets of Christianity.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Aaron Swartz likewise held the technology intelligentsia in the palm of his hand from a very young age, and was always compelled to progressive causes. He also was <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/53">prosecuted</a> by an angry and vengeful justice system.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Both are seen as martyrs; men who died rather than surrender their ideals Swartz once <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/intentionalevil">said</a>: “Nobody thinks they’re doing evil — maybe because it’s just impossible to be intentionally evil, maybe because it’s easier and more effective to convince yourself you’re good — but every major villain had some justification to explain why what they were doing was good. Everybody thinks they’re good.” Would St. Valentine agree?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We can only hope that the death of a prominent figure like Aaron Swartz will provoke clarity to the causes and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aaron_swartz_memorial_service_demonstrates_the_battle_for_his_legacy.html">actors</a> who will renew the fight for liberty and equality; the two things Swartz seemed to value most.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What does Aaron Swartz’s death mean to you? How can it help foster important discussions we need to have as a community? How can we better honor, reward, and sustain creative passions in our society?</p>
