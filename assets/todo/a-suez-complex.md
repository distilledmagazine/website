<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1956, the combined forces of Israel, Britain and France invaded Egypt in response to Gamal Abdel Nasser’s <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Suez_crisis" target="_blank">nationalization of the Suez Canal</a>. The operation was a tactical and military success but it would soon turn into a humiliating diplomatic defeat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Soviets threatened to respond with missile strikes, while the Americans enforced an oil embargo and threatened to sell off US Government Bonds held in Sterling, a move that would have seen the British currency plummet. There was simply no choice but to withdraw and it also became quickly clear that global geopolitics had changed significantly; European states were no longer the world’s great powers. Significantly for the British, it was a definitive sign that the country’s pre-WWII power would not be restored and the sun had finally set on the empire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In response to the embarrassment and out of desperation to hold on to the status as one of the world’s preeminent powers, French Prime Minister Guy Mollet actually <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Franco-British_Union#Suez_Crisis_.281956.29" target="_blank">proposed a union with Britain</a> involving a single head of state and a common citizenship! The offer was rejected and the French would go on to sign the Treaty of Rome with five other European states instead, creating the European Economic Community, the forerunner to the EU.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Britain would eventually join too but its reasons were largely different and purely economical. As a trading nation, it wanted access to the continent’s single market. For the French however, the European project was also strategic from day one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fast forward to the present day where the spectre of a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/21567940-british-exit-european-union-looks-increasingly-possible-it-would-be-reckless" target="_blank">UK withdrawal from the EU looms large</a>. The arguments for leaving or staying have taken the all too predictable economic form: Will the UK have access to the single market? Will British firms stand to benefit with less red tape from Brussels. Will foreign companies abandon their British bases? Will London lose out to Frankfurt or Paris as Europe’s financial center? Specifics aside, the question is generally if the UK is able to succeed <em>economically</em> without being in the EU. There is little talk about British influence in the world or geopolitical might.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not up for question, is how the UK intends to retain global influence in the world. This isn’t the same Britannia that ruled the waves after all and powers like China, India, Russia and others are on the rise. A united Europe can negotiate from a position of strength, while individual European countries are less likely to be successful. Just imagine New York or Florida negotiating trade terms with China.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this sense, it is bizarre that the Conservative Party, keen on British leadership in the world, is the one <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/21569710-europe-prime-minister-must-placate-five-types-conservative-tory-taxonomy" target="_blank">leading the eurosceptic charge</a>. The EU is after all the only remedy the countries of Europe have to counter their declining global influence. Former Belgian Prime Minister and current MEP Guy Verhofstadt perhaps said it best when he warned that the G8 would be devoid of any European state by 2030 if Europeans failed to unite. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski conveyed a similar message <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/watch?v=YBskdGcFz_c" target="_blank">on the BBC’s <em>Hard Talk</em></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently, British eurosceptics were outraged <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/us-warns-uk-european-union" target="_blank">when American officials told them to remain in the EU</a>. “How dare they threaten and bully us?” UKIP leader Nigel Farage demanded. Looking from a geopolitical perspective though, it is precisely because there is no united Europe that the US can tell Britain what to do. Just like they did at Suez.</p>
