<p style="text-align: justify;">It was the morning of Monday, October 29th. The sky was overcast, and were it not for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warnings and the bottomless cups of coffee at the Main Street diners, I would have believed that I was in the British isles again. From the little news we could gather from outside our political bubble, Hurricane Sandy had recently veered northward, and was now on track to tumble and fall ungracefully into the eastern seaboard of the United States of America.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One week before the election. Around noon, a soft drizzle spritzed the only window of the warehouse, a window on a room we affectionately titled the "Solarium". This was where we would hold our training calls. These conference calls would train our volunteers across the country to call voters in other parts of the country. As the day progressed, the sky darkened and the winds began to lash the fleshy autumn oaks that surrounded our temporary warehouse HQ. These training calls soon took on the urgency of bunker based wartime broadcasts – instructing the frontlines not yet besieged by the enemy to carry onward were we to vanish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Charlottesville_Pavilion_sunrise.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1257" title="Charlottesville_Pavilion_sunrise" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Charlottesville_Pavilion_sunrise-198x300.jpg" width="198" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The warehouse main room hung off the Solarium like a gourd off its vine. There our paid staffers called voters across the country on behalf of left-wing candidates like Elizabeth Warren, Tammy Baldwin, Alan Grayson, Sherrod Brown, etc. In the garage bay attached to the main warehouse room were stacks of food (cereals, Funyuns, black beans, etc.) and crates of water. Canisters of gasolines flanked an emergency generator, which our local volunteers had offered to generously setup and secure were we to lose power.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Night came like a thunderclap. We were still making calls to voters around the country at 9pm. By 10pm I had stepped out of the warehouse for the first time that day. The CSX cargo train that ran by the warehouse stomped steadily past the cafe that adjoined our warehouse. The streetlights lining the Main Street flickered behind both the train cars and the curtains of rain that fell in diverging asymptotic streaks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I stood outside, I saw freezing gales sweep up all the fallen leaves of Charlottesville into their own mini-typhoons. These fall cyclones cavorted in the streets with the other debris in a menacing square dance. And in this chaos we were prepared to continue talking to voters and coordinating volunteers across the nation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were all gripped by a manic fervor, borne of an urgency lent by Sandy and the feeling that our country teetered on the cusp of something, anything. Something big and awful and inspiring and great. I soon realized that democracy was far messier than I had ever imagined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Stay tuned for Part II</em></p>
