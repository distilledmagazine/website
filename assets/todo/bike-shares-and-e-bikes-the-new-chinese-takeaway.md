<p><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ChinaBike.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215" title="China Bicycle Kingdom" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ChinaBike.jpeg" alt="" width="512" height="341" /></a></p>
<p>With a burgeoning middle class and unprecedented economic growth (oh, and not to mention the more than 1.3 billion inhabitants), it didn’t come as much of a surprise when China surpassed the United States as the world’s <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/china-passes-u-s-as-biggest-energy-consumer-as-oil-imports-jump-iea-says.html">largest energy consumer</a>  two years ago. In fact, China currently eats up more than <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/china-energy-use-2012-8?op=1">more than 20%</a> of global consumption. In an effort to curb its soaring energy needs, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases just announced plans to earmark <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/idCABRE87L01920120822">$372 billion</a> for energy conservation projects over the next three-and-a-half years.</p>
<p>An estimated 2000 new cars roll into the streets of Beijing every day and at the current rate of over a million vehicles sold each month, China is on pace to become the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/article.cfm?id=the-price-of-gas-in-china">largest purchaser</a> of automobiles by 2020. With half of the global consumption of oil (upwards of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/index.cfm">86 million barrels per day</a>) ultimately filtered through exhaust pipes around the world, the Eastern giant may just have a looming oil predicament on its hands.</p>
<p>One of the most direct effects of exploding demand and a thirst for gaining knowledge in this sector has been a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/snapshot-chinese-investment-in-north-american-energy-in-2012">host of investment </a>in North American energy companies.</p>
<p>But as much as China may be facing an oil problem it equally faces a potential transportation problem that is fueled by the emergence of an urban sprawl, the likes of which the planet has never seen.</p>
<p>How will China cope with these twin terrors?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>There are now 43 Chinese cities that can boast of having over a million residents — a number that is expected to swell to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/the_souls_of_chinese_cities">221 by 2025</a>. These mega-cities, largely never even heard of by Westerners, are not only likely to drive China’s economy in the coming decades but will also have the capacity to change the nation’s transportation landscape.</p>
<p>This issue is clearly on display when investigating the struggle for supremacy between cyclists and motorists in the world’s second largest economy. It wasn’t too long ago that major streets in metropolises featured wide lanes for bikes, plenty of room to park on sidewalks, and an expectation that cyclists had the right of way while crossing through intersections.</p>
<p>Paralleling the surge in automobiles, however, China began investing heavily in infrastructure to make the country more conducive to drivers, which resulted in cyclists being squeezed from the foreground into the background.</p>
<p>But the plight of the cyclist has made a major comeback as part of the effort to curb emissions and unsnarl the country’s mounting traffic congestion. The renewed focus has been nourished by the explosion of electronic bikes and bike sharing programs.</p>

<p>The growth of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/the-worlds-most-popular-way-to-get-around">bike sharing</a> plans is exemplified in the Northern Capital as Beijing announced last year that it would increase its program to include <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/article.cfm?id=bike-sharing-comes-to-china">50,000 public bikes</a> by 2015, in addition to installing cameras to snare motorists who opt to drive in bike lanes.</p>
<p>The development of bike sharing programs has been dwarfed by the relatively sudden increase in the popularity of e-bikes. With sales expected to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/4413">top 30 million</a>  this year, 92% of the world’s e-bikes are currently sold in the world’s most populous nation. And with many commuters recognizing that the prestige attached to car ownership may not be worth the financial tradeoff or aggravation, the belief is that China could very well be the nation that is in the best position to shift from e-bikes to the development and mass consumption of electric cars.</p>
