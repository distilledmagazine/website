<p>Here at <strong><em><a href="http://www.distilledmagazine.com">Distilled</a> </em></strong>HQ, we have been receiving our first batch of contributions to the next issue (check out how to submit an article <a href="http://www.distilledmagazine.com/contribute">here</a>, deadline September 21st!). As we review and edit these drafts, my thoughts have turned to language. Like an errant comet gliding past the solar system, my ruminations have been pulled into an orbit around George Orwell's 1946 essay "<em><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/orwell46.htm">Politics and the English Language</a></em>." <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/?p=203">Again</a>.</p>
<p>What is it about <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/orwell46.htm">this essay</a> that keeps snaring me in its trap? Every time I embark on a round of editing, I discover authors, including myself, making a few of the same mistakes this essay describes. Written only a few years before Orwell died, this essay is a condemnation of vaseline-slathered writing and an exhortation to crisp, colorful, and precise diction — especially in the realm of politics.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, few involved in politics over the past 66 years seem to have drunken their fill of Orwell's advice. Some days it seems that words are more meaningless now than they were immediately after the war where people were hell-bent on destroying meaning altogether.</p>

<p>Why does language always seem to be in permanent decline? Is it possible for any one person, or even a concerted group of people, to direct the flow of language? These are the questions that underpin <em>Politics and the English Language.</em></p>
<p>Today, I intend on discussing whether it is even worth attempting to improve the way we write and speak.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Orwell makes an argument for how laziness, more than malice, can lead to a vicious cycle of deterioration:</p>
<blockquote><p>"It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts."</p></blockquote>
<p>He then points out that the process is reversible: within every vicious cycle lies a virtuous cycle, and vice-versa. A conscious effort to improve language ought to lead to ever-improving language.</p>
<p>Orwell decries, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lack of precision and a staleness of imagery.</li>
<li>The overuse of Latin words rather than shorter, sharper Anglo-Saxon equivalents – often used to obfuscate rather than clarify*.</li>
<li>Filler words and phrases that are remnants of once vivid metaphors.</li>
<li>The reliance on passive rather than active constructions. For example, compare the ubiquitous "I made mistakes" versus "Mistakes were made", or "I'm sorry for what I've done" versus "I'm sorry you were offended by what happened."</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the examples of abhorrent language Orwell gives and devises , such as</p>
<blockquote><p>Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account.</p></blockquote>
<p>seem too familiar, as if we've seen it before. Maybe we have. Orwell argues that such English can only lead to a deterioration of the political discourse. Surely we have all floated political discussions solely on hot air at some point in our lives. I'm tempted to see how far randomly generated nonsense, ala the passage above, would fly in our political landscape (a political version of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Sokal_affair" Social Text">The Sokal Affair</a>).</p>
<p>While Orwell's advice may seem reasonable, rules can also petrify a language. Who is Orwell to decide what is right or wrong?</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/article_detail.asp">review</a> by <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/scholar.asp">Joseph Epstein</a> of Henry Hitchings new book, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347313919&amp;sr=8-1"><em>The Language Wars: A History of Proper English</em></a>, Epstein cites Hitchings making an interesting defense of playing with language. Hitchings advocates changing "everyone is" to "everyone are," making "Everyone is certain that he or she is correct" to "Everyone are certain that they are correct." In the correct usage, it is necessary to use "he or she" to be inclusive, whereas in the incorrect usage "he or she" is replaced by the slightly more compact and perhaps even more inclusive "they." Hitchings points out that "Some usages regarded as illiterate are really acts of discretion." Sometimes when language changes, it changes for the better.</p>
<p>Of course, if you're supplying a change in the language, then you must have demand for your product, right? The free-market view of language is typical of language descriptivists (those who believe that there is little a language scold could do). Epstein describes this frame as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>The descriptivist goes with the flow, thinks of language as existing in an ecosystem. The descriptivist view is the linguistic equivalent of the free marketeer; as the invisible hand of the market will in the end cause all things to work out for the best for the free marketeer, so the invisible lexicographer will turn the same trick for language for the descriptivist.</p></blockquote>
<p>No surprise, but I don't really buy language as a "free-market." Sure, some words and phrases enter circulation due to their popular appeal ("cool!") while others quickly drop out when they become stale ("golly gee!"). Yet, it is possible for an individual with a podium to raise a word — for example, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/the-story-behind-obamas-shellacking">Obama's use of the word "shellacking"</a> after the 2010 midterm election greatly increased its circulation in American politics. It is also possible for <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/List_of_language_regulators">regulatory agencies</a>, such as the French Academy, to stem the tide. At least for a little while. I doubt many francophones use "<em>courriel"</em> instead of the English word "e-mail."</p>
<p>Epstein, like Orwell, makes a case for why we should care which way the gales blow:</p>
<blockquote><p>"...consider the word disinterested, with its core meaning of impartiality or above personal interest, which has now all but melted into the condition of a pathetic synonym for uninterested. If we lose disinterested do we not also lose the grand ideal that it represents? I fear we may already have done so, at least insofar as I find it impossible at present to name a single disinterested figure on the stage of world politics. <em>Ideas Have Consequences</em> is the title of a once famous book, but words, being the substance out of which ideas are composed, turn out to have even greater consequences."</p></blockquote>
<p>Does that mean we will inevitably lose the ability to express certain ideas, as Orwell and Epstein fear?</p>
<p>No. The ideas we are capable of expressing now, we will always be able to express. As I discuss in my <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/?p=203">book review</a> for <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345758740&amp;sr=8-1">Guy Deutscher's <em>Through the Language Glass</em></a>, the only difference language makes is what it forces a speaker to specify. Language does not, however, prevent someone from specifying or expressing anything. Therefore, the argument that we must preserve language to preserve political ideas is not compelling. Anyone can express a desire for political freedom, whether it's in French, German, Indonesian, English, Mandarin, Arabic, Finnish, Russian, Bengali, California Surfer-speak, Gullah, or sign language.</p>
<p>So why should we care about how we use language? Language allows us to communicate ideas both efficiently and poetically. It allows us to share with other people the maelstrom that resides within each of us. It helps us get things done. Improving the way we talk to each other, especially in politics, may encourage us to be more expressive and creative. A more artful command of language helps us activate passions that would otherwise be battered by the ravages of apathy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily, President Clinton demonstrated last week that clear and principled language delivered with passion and charisma still resonates with people, no matter how dense its content or how long its length:</p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzDhk3BHi6Q</p>
<p>*I devised a measure called the Orwell Ratio to quantify a speaker's desire to evade a topic. It is simply</p>
<p>Orwell Ratio = the number of syllables in a text / by the number of words.</p>
<p>Orwell describes in his essay how using words that come from Latin tends to obscure meaning as opposed to using those of Germanic origin. Since these Latinate words are typically loaded with prefixes and suffixes, they tend to contain more syllables per word. Generally, prefixes and suffixes of all sorts serve to repel readers from discerning a writer's meaning. Hence the preceding formula.</p>
<p>Orwell goes on to say that such evasion is characteristic in the defense of otherwise indefensible policies. I don't know about that, except to say that may only hold in English (thank you Facebook commenters who helped me determine the scope of the Orwell Ratio, and who also pointed out its uselessness in the East Asian languages, Spanish, German, etc.).</p>
