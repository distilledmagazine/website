<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Last year witnessed some major developments in furthering what is conceived as being possible in outer space. With NASA successfully landing the Curiosity Rover on Mars, and SpaceX successfully completing the first commercial payload delivery to the International Space Station (ISS), the public’s interest in the cosmos was re-captured like no other year in recent memory. And if the first month of this year is any indication, 2013 may yield even more remarkable advancements in space. Here’s an overview of some of the non-military highlights.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">NASA’s one-ton Curiosity Rover is still busy on Mars, making use of its 10 different scientific instruments that will hopefully determine if the planet has ever been capable of supporting microbial life. Last week, the robot began readying itself for the first-ever drilling activity on the Red Planet, which could be achieved any day now.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Revolutionary progress was also made that should result in satellites being used more efficiently in the near future.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Satellites have come to underpin nearly every aspect of our daily lives but also have the ability to create problems once they become inactive. By lingering in orbit, they remain vulnerable to collisions with space debris that travels at upwards of 35,000 kilometers per hour. Collisions result in lots of additional waste. With about 2500 in orbit that are inactive, the longer the 1100 active satellites stay that way, the better.<em id="__mceDel">  </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the Robotic Refueling Mission - a joint venture between NASA and the Canadian Space Agency – when  Canada’s $200 million dollar robot Dextre refuelled a mock satellite located just outside the ISS. <em id="__mceDel"><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deemed the most sophisticated space robot ever built, Dextre introduces the potential to refuel and service satellites that will extend their lifetime. This potentially means years of additional revenue for their owners and will also contribute to a more efficient use of outer space.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">January also saw the launch of Deep Space Industries, a company now competing with Planetary Resources to become the first group to commercially mine asteroids, which are rich in valuable minerals and resources and said to be crucial for any permanent space development. DSI has ambitious aspirations of beginning to mine near-Earth asteroids by 2020 and collecting between 20-45 kilograms with each mission.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NASA is currently working on OSIRIS-Rex, a program it hopes to launch in 2016 and which would begin mining in 2023. However, the billion dollar initiative only projects to return a maximum of 2 kilograms with each mission, which would make it a far less efficient venture than what DSI is proposing.</p>
