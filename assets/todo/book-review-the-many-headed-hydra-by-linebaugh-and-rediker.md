<p style="text-align: justify;">What would the modern world be without globalization? Since the end of the Cold War, this phenomenon has dominated many debates in International Relations and has become a key word to describe the current state of interconnectedness. According to many, we now live in a globalized world, a characteristic that distinguishes us from what came before. But as often happens when people make such statements, historical research catches up and puts things in perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under the auspices of historians like <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Immanuel_Wallerstein">Immanuel Wallerstein</a> and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/geoffreycgunn.com">Geoffrey Gunn</a> globalization was investigated and proclaimed to be much older. The general result of this research was the arrival of a strong ‘Yes, but...’ attitude towards globalization.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two interesting defenders of this attitude are <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/plinebaugh.html">Peter Linebaugh</a> (University of Toledo) and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/www.marcusrediker.com">Marcus Rediker</a> (University of Pittsburgh). With their <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/0807050075"><em>The Many-Headed Hydra. Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic</em></a> they embark on a truly ambitious quest. In approximately 350 pages they try to recreate an Atlantic ‘history from below’ and to ‘recover some of the lost history of the multiethnic class that was essential to the rise of capitalism and the modern, global economy’ (p.6-7).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the process they draw a picture of globalization that is refreshing and provocative but sometimes runs off with its argument. Nevertheless, they have written one of the most interesting ‘Yes, but...’ arguments the debate has seen so far.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One interesting aspect of the book is that it ignores conventional topics such as the starting date of globalization or the exact levels of interaction. Instead it focuses on the concrete impact of globalization on people and events, and on the global relations between those two. After reading this book, let no one tell you that the driving force behind the American Revolution was an enlightened colonial elite. It had many actors and was as global as it was important.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The point of departure for Linebaugh and Rediker is a social group called the ‘hewers of wood and drawers of water’, an Atlantic underclass created out of the enclosure movements, the colonial plantation system and the slave trade. This group, set adrift by the events of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, populated the British port cities, the Caribbean Islands, and the American coasts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Between 1600 and 1850 these people struggled with their unjust slavery and the expropriation of their land by a capitalist elite, and fought for a return to the commons. Just as the mythological hydra, which severed heads reappeared time after time, this class fought against the memory of Hercules, the defender of order and kinglike powers. And what made the continuous reappearance of this revolutionary beast possible were forces of globalization: the Atlantic currents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to demonstrate that the sea connected events, ideas and people on every shore, Linebaugh and Rediker use a wide pallet of Atlantic-class personages. The chapter on Edward and Catherine Despard is in this respect a masterpiece, as we follow Edward’s evolution from an Anglo-Irish magnate to a royal assassin sentenced to death. During his life Despard was moulded by the Atlantic currents. His service as a royal officer in Jamaica, Nicaragua and Belize exposed him to the malicious treatment of the hewers and drawers, stimulating him to take action on their behalf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is with this approach that the book excels: using the life of a few characters, the authors convincingly defend the case that globalization is about <em>overall</em> interconnection, and that nobody escapes its influence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately their use of historical sources has its weaknesses. One of the problems with ‘histories from below’ is that archival evidence is hard to find. As feminist historians discovered earlier, poor, non-male or non white groups within history often did not leave extensive primary sources. And the material we do have is often heavily distorted by the perspectives of their elite creators.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier reviews have therefore criticised the book for its meagre body of sources. These critiques often contended that Linebaugh and Rediker’s empirical base is so thin that they needed to interpret their material solely in ways supportive of their own predetermined claims. <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/armitage">David Armitage</a> for example produced a review in which he called Linebaugh and Rediker’s book ‘an ambitious work of bricolage’, containing an ‘ingenious overreading of fragmentary sources or of second-hand and prejudiced testimony’, mainly intended to solve the ‘impasse within Marxist historiography’.<a title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>Less harsh was <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Martin_Glaberman">Martin Glaberman</a>, who nuanced the discussion by admitting that Linebaugh and Rediker sometimes jump to conclusions but that this does not debauche their overall argument.<a title="" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take for example their concept of the ‘motley crew’. Linebaugh and Rediker claim that Early Modern globalization was not simply the prerogative of the upper classes, buying spices and collecting exotic artefacts. Atlantic trade mixed the most unlikely people (from Native Americans over African slaves to Irish labourers) and bound them together into egalitarian and creative groups. In these groups they found equally tormented people, with whom they could relate and organise resistance. And according to the authors it was exactly the motley crew’s struggle that drove history forward in this period, as it lead to many revolutions and kept the elites constantly on guard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So although one can image the existence of motley crews, this last point is exemplary of Linebaugh and Rediker’s tendency to overstate their argument: they also should not fool you when you are told that seventeenth-century pirates were a bunch of egalitarian free spirits fighting evil capitalists.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless they clearly have a point in describing globalization as an all-in phenomenon. Whether by reading letters of a rebellion across the ocean or seeing it on a television screen, the recipient is influenced by these events and becomes part of a global current. So in many ways <em>The Many-Headed Hydra</em> has the possibility of being cited as a ground breaking piece of scholarship. Its attention to the lower classes of society, to unconventional historical connections and currencies and to unfamiliar aspects of politics make it a great starting point for reframing future global studies.</p>
