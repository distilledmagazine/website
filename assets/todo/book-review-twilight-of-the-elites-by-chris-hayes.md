<p style="text-align: justify;">How do we decide who gets ahead in our society and who doesn't? Simple. We reward those who work hard, are smart and curious, and are willing to innovate and take risks. If you aren't successful and rich, then you must not have worked hard enough or have been bright enough to make it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So went the conventional wisdom, until the global crisis of confidence, as described in <a href="http://www.distilledmagazine.com">the first issue of Distilled</a>. People all around the world started questioning institutions and authorities: governments, businesses, economists, bankers, everyone. For good reason. Now that we are nearly four years into the crisis, it has become clear that our elite, who govern these institutions, have failed us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Chris_Hayes_(journalist)">Chris Hayes</a>, editor with <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/www.thenation.com">The Nation magazine</a> and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/upwithchrishayes.msnbc.com">MSNBC host</a>, has written a book   <em><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347895833&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=twilight+of+the+elites">Twilight of the Elites: America After Meritocracy</a> </em>about the continuing fall of the ruling class<em>.</em> He observes in the opening chapter that "we now operate in a world in which we can assume neither competence nor good faith from the authorities, and the consequences of this simple, devastating realization is the defining feature of American life at the end of this low dishonest decade." Clearly, this book isn't going to be much like other "Twilight" books.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hayes cites a provocative speech given before the World Economic Forum in Davos (an elite gathering if ever was one) by President Bill Clinton:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Go all the way back to Sumerian civilization, and you'll see that every successful civilization builds institutions that work, that lift people up and reward people for their greatness. Then, if you look at every one of those civilizations, all those institutions that benefited people get long in the tooth. They get creaky. The people ruling them become more interested in holding on to power than the purpose they were designed for. That's where we are now in the public and private sector."</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hayes connects Clinton's observation with "The Iron Law of Oligarchy," a theory initially devised by early-20th century social theorist <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Robert_Michels">Robert Michels</a>. Quite simply, "The Iron Law of Oligarchy" is a desire for those in an elite position to ensure that their children and others like them also ascend into the elite. Pulling-up-the-ladder, as Hayes calls it, is by no means a malicious or even an intentional desire. Yet, it does over time produce an institutional upper class devoted to protecting only its interests and divorced from . So while the meritocracy often has many benefits (it compels many to strive for success and is ostensibly blind to race, gender, etc.), it is by nature self-corrupting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another problem with meritocracy is the use of incentive structures that often perverts goals. The most recent example of how incentives can corrupt institutions is the issue of bonuses at investment banks. By awarding bonuses to bankers and traders, the bank is incentivizing its employees to work hard and produce a profit for the company. Yet, in practice, these bonuses encourage employees to take dangerous short-term risks, which over the long-term could destroy the bank itself. Coupled with the pulling-up-the-ladder effect, this leads to a ruling class that harms other members of society and itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After describing many examples in which the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/why-elites-fail">meritocracy evolves into oligarchy</a>, and how the elite distances itself from the rest of society, Hayes asks the most important question: is there an alternative to a meritocracy? There have been other means of constructing elites in the past: hereditary aristocracy, nepotism, religious revelation, etc. While the meritocratic ideal is the best way we've devised for selecting elites so far, it is by no means the only way available to us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe that the alternative to meritocracy is a system of social advancement that is not solely dependent on incentives and disincentives to motivate people. Clearly there are some things we want people to do. We want members of a society to work and help each other, to not harm others, to do the morally right thing (whatever that may be), and to be civically involved. We can argue and negotiate about the crucial details of these values, but we must not simply assume that economic incentives are the only way to compel people to pursue them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our view of people is too simplistic. Humans are complex dynamic systems that are not always rational. We incorporate feedback from our environments, make hasty decisions with little information, and are constantly changing. Our motivations are drawn from a desire for more money, for better health, for a sense of security, for love and passion, etc. We want to be active, to stave off boredom, to create things, to feel they have value, and to create work that they feel is worthwhile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These desires come from some internal set of principals tied to a narrative about how we see ourselves and the world around us. If you treat people like robotic products of an assembly line that only respond to economic incentives and disincentives, then they will behave like villainous automatons that cannot be trusted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under our increasingly oligarchic system, Hayes posits, we no longer have a left/right distinction so much as an insurrectionists/institutionalists distinction. Certainly this dynamic has driven a greater divide between Tom Friedman/David Brooks technocratic center-ism and the likes of the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street than between the Democratic and Republican parties. According to Hayes "what divides the institutionalist from the insurrectionist is a disagreement over whether the greatest threat we face is distrust – a dark and nihilistic tendency that will produce a society bankrupted of norms and order – or whether the greater threat is the actual malfeasance and corruption of the pillar institutions themselves."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, designing a system where people strive to succeed for reasons other than wealth and prestige is difficult. Motivations, even if they were reliably quantifiable, fluctuate and intermix so often that no one could ever accurately describe what motivates them at any given moment. The key to developing an effective way of framing and organizing society will be the incorporation of feedback — a system where incentive structures and rules are flexible enough to encompass the full range of human motivation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For Hayes, the solution to the oligarchy problem is to support policies that encourage equality of outcome in addition to equality of opportunity. For example, rather than just allowing every child to take a standardized exam to get into a better school, we would also ensure that every child's parents are provided enough income to properly provide support outside of school. Better yet, we would seek to make every school of equal quality and accessibility, rather than force them to compete against each other for resources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe that this is a good start, but eventually there will be some way to rig the system again. Hayes defines the problems we face and identifies the upper middle class as the future leadership and power base for change, but only begins to scratch the surface of the solutions we must devise to have a prosperous stable America, and indeed a sustainable global society, after meritocracy. These solutions would have to acknowledge an eternal struggle between the insurrections and institutionalists.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our time of crisis, where our elites have failed us, we must reconsider what motivates people, how they interact with each other, and what sort of world we want to live in. Then we must plot a course for how to get there.</p>
