<p>Our education system is an assembly line. On one end are the inputs: books, computers, pencils, teachers, and of course students. On the other end are graduates who we expect to be retitled employees soon after graduation. The process takes many years, twelve to sixteen for most people, and involves transfers from one institution to the next. By the end, we expect to produce not only raw input to sustain our global economy, but also decent citizens who are ready, able, and willing to participate in a vibrant civic society.</p>
<p>There was a time in which we adhered to these lofty ideals about what constitutes a university education. College was meant to make you a critical thinker, a well-rounded person, an appreciator of the rich nuances in the world around us, and a thoughtful, engaged citizen of your local and global community. Unfortunately, these characteristics are slowly being washed away in favor of incentive structures geared toward producing cogs in large corporate machines.</p>
<p class="break">Ironically, it's the employers who have now started to complain about our colleges. For several reasons, a college degree nowadays is not even enough anymore for a graduate to be considered a good employee. College graduates have been found to lack written and oral communication, decision-making, and analytical skills, all qualities that employers have traditionally expected from college graduates.</p>
<p>But who is it that should be responsible for training graduates? Colleges or businesses? As one employer said, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/137625" target="_blank">according to this article</a> in the Chronicle for Higher Education: "To expect business to bring graduates up to speed... That’s too much to ask." Colleges retort that this responsibility falls to employers who previously have run trainee programs to get their hires trained to do the job.</p>
<p>The least colleges should do, is to instill basic critical thinking into their graduates. Why is it that colleges fail after four long years to achieve this goal? Simple: Colleges select people who are good at working hard and studying for standardized exams. Once in college, students are expected to continue working hard, make good grades, and focus on getting a job at the end of their four or five years. When the focus is on making the good grades and on the “college experience”, college students are incentivized to take the easy way through school, to focus on degrees and classes that are relatively non-critical. On top of that, slews of classes are massive and poorly taught. Critical engagement is too much of a burden to overstretched professors and graduate students. As the internets might say to these colleges: <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/you-had-one-job" target="_blank">"You had one job!"</a></p>
<p class="break">Even if you do get a job with a college degree, it just doesn’t seem the jobs are any good. As cited in the aforementioned Chronicle article, the Center for College Affordability and Productivity has found that almost half of all American college graduates in 2010 were underemployed, holding jobs that require less than a Bachelor’s degree.</p>
<p>So what good is a college degree then? According to one employer in the Chronicle article, having a B.A. indicates that you have staying power, essentially that you work hard and have put in the effort. In the end, isn’t this what the employers wanted out of college graduates in the first place? They wanted employees who were obedient. Unfortunately they got graduates who are both obedient and dumb.</p>
