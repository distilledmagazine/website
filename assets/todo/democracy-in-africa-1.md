<p style="text-align: justify;">Friday 7 December marked the seventh free and fair election in the Republic of Ghana. The country has long been hailed as a model for African democracy in a volatile region. It serves as a lynchpin in the ECOWAS economic area and provides a stable, less interesting (for all the right reasons) foil to Nigeria's persistent post-colonial sectarian conflicts and natural resource crises.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many news outlets reported on second or third page news these developments, and will have relayed them at face value. As in most of Ghanaian culture, the country's political traditions are full of history and a richness that largely did not make it into most analyses in non-Afro-centric sources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Dramani Mahama of the National Democratic Congress took the title in the first round with 50.7% of the popular vote, forgoing the need for a run-off which would have been scheduled for 28 December. The NDC has de facto inherited the populist tradition of the country's founder and renowned pan-Africanist Kwame Nkrumah. This, despite the fact that Nkrumah's party, the CPP does still exist. The only member of parliament the party has is Nkrumah's daughter, Samia. They are the party of the country's last military dictator although the association is almost pointless as there is nothing in common from those days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/democracy-in-africa-1/ghana1/" rel="attachment wp-att-2185"><img class="wp-image-2185 alignleft" alt="ghana1" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ghana1.jpg" width="284" height="378" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, Ghana has never been a country that any dictator could hold power in for any impressive amount of time. This is attributed to the two main political traditions that exist in the two main modern parties, the Nkrumaist tradition, and the Danquah-Busia tradition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The two factions have existed since the founding fathers of the country ran into ideological disagreements. They agreed on the need for independence, but that was about it. Since then, they have always been strong enough to rally support against the other if they attempted to seize power for too long undemocratically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eight candidates entered this year's race, although the only party with a realistic shot of beating the incumbent NDC was the New Patriotic Party. Their leader Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo amassed 48% of the votes from the poll – a serious disappointment for partisans. The NPP had been counting on a return to power after being ousted in the 2008 competition. Before that they had been the party responsible for bringing Ghana the African Cup of Nations and other major infrastructural developments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fact that one of the last constructions they pursued was an enormous and rather gaudy presidential palace did not bode well however. This was a political gambit gone wrong. The idea was to build it such that the incumbent could not enter because of the two-term limit in the country's constitution; the electorate however gained a symbol of overspending and self-importance to rail against. When the NDC took power President John Atta-Mills continued living in the former colonial castle that has traditionally been the president's residence. Towards the end of his term, he decided that it would be worth taking up the new residence. Atta-Mills passed away this year in July, leaving the Vice-President Mahama in charge. He has had the last few months to prove his ability to govern, and it seems he has succeeded in doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The NPP, Ghana's opposition party, have attempted politically to position themselves as the more sobriquet alternative to what they portray as the brutishness of the ruling NDC. While they are traditionally the party of lawyers and academics, they certainly are guilty of enough of their own rhetoric, not to mention a persistent poor-losing streak, contesting both of the last two elections when they lost them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In current times, the characterisation of the NDC as trigger-happy is rather hyperbolic as well. They were founded by strongman Jerry Rawlings as a transition from military rule, but are still associated with his regime by detractors. Still, it has been a long time since the 1980s when Rawlings persecuted the 'rich' by dispossessing or shooting anyone with more than one loo in their house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is also part of the explanation behind why the Ghanaian diaspora, especially strong in London and Toronto, is particularly well-educated and less volatile than other exile groups. They were the intelligentsia, a product of founding father Kwame Nkrumah's insistence on a well-developed educational infrastructure. Many of the élite have not yet forgotten this era, and thus maintain stronger ties to the NPP in an effort to keep the NDC out of office. During their time in office from 2000 to 2008, the NPP succeeded in putting Ghana on the path to middle-income status, which it achieved in 2010. This means more investment and less highly-discounted Least Developed Country aid.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is however mostly symbolic, but importantly so. It is seen as moving from institutional life-support to rehab.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To build on the process, it was the NDC that became associated with the 2007 oil find, as they were the ones to decide what to do with the blessing. Dutch disease was the word of the day in Ghana, and donor countries (with the exception of China) were asking fair questions such as “if you are a middle income oil country why are we giving you free Official Development Assistant?” What the West's ambassadors did not admit publicly but which they understood, importantly, was that Ghana really is a democracy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ghana has had two changeovers of power in twenty years of increasingly free and fair polls and has one of the most profoundly developed and rabid civil societies in Africa. The members of this civil society do understand that they are blessed however. They understand they could have it much worse. Ghanaians will lament the shortcoming of their government, as someone very memorably described to me the country's first elections as having the military dictator Jerry Rawlings "simultaneously playing the roles of manager, coach, and referee in the contest".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img title="Column" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/trans.gif" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Still, Ghana knows there is no need for the big black star at the centre of the country's main roundabout to become a new Tahrir.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is important for answering Western critics. Ghana is not hoarding aid that could be better used elsewhere, it's still a prime candidate for aid. Ghana is not ready to stand on its own, although it is moving that way, albeit at a nearly glacial pace. In a free democracy, discourse does not necessarily reflect reality. In Ghana it is laden with the pomp and grandeur of how oil will turn Ghana into a hybrid of Gulf Country prosperity and Scandinavian democratic values. The oil is estimated to bring in its first billion to the budget by 2015, if all the profits aren't pillaged by foreign governments and firms or simply vanish as illicit financial flows. The government has to act as if it can use this to pull the country out of the economic mire that characterises most of Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Atta-Mills’ administration decided against a Sovereign Wealth Fund, and mostly took loans against future revenues. At the time much of the media was suggesting this was because the NDC was assuming a loss in the election on the seventh. Now they will have to manage any debt they have incurred themselves, which will be an interesting test in diligence for the party that has a chance to remake its image in Ghana, and build one in the first place abroad. The world might begin paying attention, and Ghana can make a case for itself as a truly exceptional country if the next four to eight years go according to some hypothetical ideal plan. Mahama will create or lose a legacy based on whether or not he can elucidate what such a plan would look like.</p>
