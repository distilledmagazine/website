<p style="text-align: justify;">Already from its conception, Distilled set as its foremost task to stimulate writing and debate amongst the brave and talented of our generation. As they are too often overlooked, we want to help future leaders secure a place in public debate by providing the necessary advice, opportunity, and reflection on their ideas.<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/distilled_logo.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3370" alt="distilled_logo" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/distilled_logo-300x172.png" width="300" height="172" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But we are not alone in doing so. Many organisations have taken up this challenge, and see it as an utter necessity that those who are at the beginning of their career are not hindered by conventional wisdom or disillusioned older generations. These groups have made it to their mission to stimulate students and young professionals, to have them seek out the extremities of the possible, and to nurture their talents to the benefit of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of these organisations is the KULeuven Model United Nations (<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/www.kulmun.be">KULMUN</a>) society. Through a yearly re-enactment of the sessions of the United Nations, held in the city of Leuven but involving people from virtually every country in Europe, they build and expand on the diplomatic capital of our university students. And most importantly, they have only one major condition for participation: you are in it because you want to make a difference for the world, not because you want a nice reference on your CV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Distilled has the same goals, we can only applaud the opportunities KULMUN provides to students with the right motivation. And because we believe it to be paramount that such similar ambitions should reinforce rather than hinder one another, Distilled is proud to announce that <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/newswire.kulmun.be">KULMUN Newswire</a>, the journalistic sidekick of the MUN, is our <i>first official partner</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The KULMUN Newswire was originally designed to report on the yearly KULMUN conference, but also offers its contributors the opportunity to write on actual global politics. As part of our partnership, Distilled Extra has agreed to run some of their articles over the coming months, and to provide an external report on their conference due in March. We are looking forward to see what their writers have to offer, and hope to spike a debate between our readers and theirs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So have a look at the articles they have on display, and challenge them the Distilled way: be prepared to stake your ground and defend it. Wisely.</p>
