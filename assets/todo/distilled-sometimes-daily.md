<p>Sometimes you just have to put your head down, stick your nose to the grindstone, pull an all-nighter, invest some blood, sweat, and tears, and other expressions for working hard.</p>
<p>That is why Distilled Daily will be going into a 3 (or 4) times a week posting schedule until the 11th of October. Why? We have received several excellent articles from you, our readers, for our second issue. In order to do justice to your contributions and maintain a high level of quality for <strong><em>Distilled</em><em> Magazine</em></strong>, we have decided to focus on editing the magazine over the next two weeks.</p>
<p>But if you would like to contribute a short piece to Distilled Daily, please contact us at editor@distilledmagazine.com or one of the editors. We'd be happy to have you!</p>
<p>Finally, we are only a few days away from the end of our fundraiser for a print edition of the second issue. If you would like to support us and receive a copy of <strong><em>Distilled</em></strong> delivered to your door, please visit our <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/distilled-magazine-second-issue-print-edition1">Kickstarter page</a> and contribute $10 (about £6 or 8€).</p>
<p>Thank you for your contributions, your donations, and your support!</p>
