excerpt: During the U.S. election we were faced with an oversupply of information.
  Did logic help making sense of all this?

<p style="text-align: justify;">Yesterday, Bram De Ridder aptly explained <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/relief-and-belief/">why us Europeans followed the U.S. elections</a> as if they were our own. The Obama campaign resonated across the Atlantic because of it message hope and change. The tone this year around might have been far less positive than in 2008, but compared to our own E.U. shenanigans, it was Christmas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That wasn't the only reason to follow the election though, the opposing Mitt Romney campaign did it's bit as well. Yes, for the last year Romney has been the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/watch?v=cU0MVdq_ioQ" target="_blank">king of unintentional comedy</a>. Especially his <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mitt-romney-britain-gaffes" target="_blank">trip to the U.K. in the summer</a> could compete with the best comedy made on British soil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But to be fair to him, part of the blame should go to the way we cover U.S. elections. Bored with our own boring political theatre, the world looks to America for excitement. We want zingers, we want gaffes; anything but the really important debates. This is shown splendidly by the excellent <em>Foreign Policy </em>satire <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/game_change_china_edition" target="_blank">"What if American political reporters covered the Chinese horse race?"</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Li's puzzling decision to break into a few lines of Shakespeare — in fluent English — was "intended to show his chops on foreign policy," according to a source close to the Li campaign. But it inadvertently played into the shadowy third-party ads seeking to exploit rumors that the worldly Li was not born in China.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maybe political commentators in the West should walk a mile in the shoes of their colleagues in China, who still face a Mao-like veil of secrecy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Faced with a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/21562956" target="_blank">total absence of verifiable facts</a>, they still have to construct a coherent narrative. The difficulty of this task was exemplified by a 1975 CIA report on the matter, at one point desperately asking the question "Does Logic Help?".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a foreigner dipping my toe into U.S.-watching, I ask myself the same question. Not because of a lack of information, but because an oversupply. When trying to follow the election online, your Twitter feed basically turns into a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Gish_Gallop" target="_blank">Gish Gallop</a> of meaningless truths and significant lies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But this cycle help was at hand. Statistician <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/fivethirtyeight" target="_blank">Nate Silver</a> combined different polls in such a way that he succesfully predicted all 50 states. But even <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/watch?v=f9CKaTpKPxo" target="_blank">more than a victory for math</a>, his achievement is a victory of logic. Faced with a vast quantity of contradicting polls, Silver had to make reasoned choices and critically reasses his own model all the time. Doing so, he succeeded where others failed: seeing the narrative in a seemingly vast stream of conflicting evidence. So yes, logic does help. As does evidence.</p>
