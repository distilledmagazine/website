<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/www.thediamondjubilee.org">Jubilee</a> celebrations are over. The <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/its-official-olympics-gave-britains-economy-a-much-needed-bump" target="_blank">Olympics are but a distant memory</a>. Wiggo has already <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/18946960">won his trophy</a>, and Murray has laid claim to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/18907001">winning (at) Wimbledon</a>. Now it's December, and Britain's summer of triumph has lapsed into a bitter winter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and the Cameron government are <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/george-osborne-rich-share-income" target="_blank">proposing a fresh new round of austerity measures</a>. These cuts include £3.75 billion from reducing the cost-of-living adjustment on welfare and eliminating £31 billion from government departments across Whitehall after 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ostensibly, these measures will also be paired with tax increases on the wealthiest of Brits. The result? A significant decrease to the UK sovereign debt. So does this make the UK a model nation, on the path to fiscal responsibility unlike those messy Europeans?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/watch?v=InTAt2hI_kg">No.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/www.resolutionfoundation.org">The Resolution Foundation</a> has analyzed these proposals and found that the poorest 10% will lose six times as much of their income as the richest 10%. Osborne pushed back on a Radio 4 interview, insisting that the closing of tax loopholes would mean the richest 20% would be harder hit with a loss of 4% of their income.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter" title="george osborn" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/KFdZlxD2B0uANKfozc8ghw2.jpg" width="270" height="236" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Setting aside the relative vagueries of closing tax loopholes offered by the Conservative government, one thing ought to be clear to the bright Oxford graduates of the Cameron administration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even a small hit to the poorer classes is far more devastating than a substantially larger hit to the wealthy. When a larger portion of your income is devoted to food, housing, and basic needs, then any decline in income is going to have a greater effect than a similar reduction on those who can already easily afford those basic needs. Such an unfair distribution of burden serves to further deteriorate the inter-socio-economic bonds of the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Big_society">"Big Society"</a> and destroys opportunities for those hit by austerity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The UK is also a country that can avail itself of many more options in dealing with its deficit by virtue of being able to print and manage its own currency. Remarkably, the precious sort in the upper echelons of British government see the increasingly <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/debt-crisis">violent and dispiriting reaction in Greece and Italy</a> against austerity as a twisted reason for more austerity in their own country. ("They're really just upset about the deficit!")</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, the Office of Budget and Responsibility has projected the UK economy to actually contract by 0.1% in 2012. The argument for expansionary austerity touted by Cameron and Osborne has, alas, also fallen on hard times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, woe betide the Americans who see their British brethren as a beacon of stiff upper-lip fair play – a model to be copied. With the "fiscal cliff" approaching at the end of December, the prevailing sentiment in the US political class, much like in Britain, is that  the deficit is the source of the recession and unemployment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Ts_eliot">T.S. Eliot</a>, an American turned Brit who moonlighted as a banker while writing pretty words, didn't think <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/1.html">December was the cruelest month</a>.</p>
