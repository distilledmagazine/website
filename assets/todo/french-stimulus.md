<p>The French are missing something. That <em>je ne sais quoi</em> that has dominated their economy for a long time. People just <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/business/global/consumer-concerns-weigh-down-french-economy.html" target="_blank">aren’t buying things anymore</a>. French producers and shop owners believe that it must be some vague lack of confidence in the future, some indescribable ennui gripping the French public.</p>
<p>I do know <em>qu'est qu'est</em> the problem. France has an unemployment rate that is peaking at 10.8% and a record high savings rate that is strangling the economy. The French aren't buying things anymore because they don’t have jobs, and they don’t have money. Salaries remain stagnant and once bustling markets have come to a standstill as shop-owners struggle to find enough customers to stay afloat one more month. There's also a general lack of confidence in the future and a consequent inclination to save. France is in its second shallow recession in four years.</p>
<p class="break">So what is the government’s solution to this rut? President François Hollande has proposed a government stimulus of 12 billion euros (about 15.5 billion dollars) to be spent in the energy, digital, aerospace, and health sectors.</p>
<p>Since WWII, it has been clear that government spending and investment is an effective way to stimulate aggregate demand and help break out of a liquidity crisis, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/more-on-not-so-miserable-france/" target="_blank">such as the one that France is currently suffering</a>. With low consumer spending and without a significant structural deficit, stimulus is a clear prescription for France’s ailing economy. That said, 12 billion euros frankly is not much. This package, even relative to France’s smaller economy, is about 10.6 percent the size of the American stimulus, a plan that has since been widely panned for being too small. This plan is hardly a bold step forward in spending.</p>
<p>Moreover, why were energy, digital, aerospace, and health chosen as the sectors for investment and stimulus? These are areas where jobs are highly skilled and highly productive, not the best qualities if one is seeking to boost the employment of largely young, low-skilled workers. These are sectors that produce big-ticket items, so purchasing the goods and services that are produced by this sector would remain largely outside the purchasing power of many French citizens. They were chosen because they are prestigious, impressive areas that other economically-successful countries have excelled in. So why not France?</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at where the money will go by inspecting the aerospace sector. France is a leader in aerospace, being the home of Airbus, a leading aircraft manufacturer. Airbus makes a revenue of approximately 33 billion euros a year and constitutes a significant portion of France’s aerospace sector. Yet it employs only about 22 thousand French in a country of 65 million (as of December 2006), with much of Airbus’s workforce in other EU countries and around the world. Paired with many of Airbus’s offshore contractors and suppliers, a significant portion of Airbus’s work is done outside of France. As a result, giving Airbus a significant boost of government stimulus is unlikely to do much for either unemployment or stimulating consumer demand.</p>
<p class="break">The crisis mongers are no better than the ruling socialists. They are still using the deficit (despite the relative lack of one) as a threat that demands renewed rounds of austerity and the dismantling of ancient labor regulations. Meanwhile, the shallow recession makes it unlikely that anyone will feel any urgency to act boldly and decisively to boost the French economy.</p>
<p>What remains is a situation where the economy will have to get far worse before anyone sees fit politically to make it better. Passing out watered down “stimulus” programs meant chiefly to appeal through the flashy sectors truly does lack a <em>je ne sais quoi</em>.</p>
