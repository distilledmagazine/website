<p id="top">So <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/390009-london-olympics-opening-ceremony.jpg" target="_blank">London 2012</a> hasn't quite become <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/rome2.jpg" target="_blank">Rome 410</a> after all.</p>
<p>I report this with a degree of surprise, because for months the authorities have done everything to make us inhabitants believe it would. We were told to either <a href="www.getaheadofthegames.com/" target="_blank">"Get Ahead of the Games"</a>, or risk being trampled by hordes of invading sports fans. Government by <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/21560268" target="_blank">"nudging"</a>, they call it. Rather than coercing groups of people into some kind of orderliness, officials use small <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/21551032" target="_blank">behavioral hints to the same effect</a>. Genious.  My favourite nudge, subtly advising us to stay away from the overcrowded city, are <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/london-rooftops-missiles-olympic-games" target="_blank">the rocket launchers on flat buildings</a>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>And it worked. Way to well it worked: last week a whole new kind of message started coming through. Rather than attracting uncontrolable masses to the touristic hotspots, the first week of Olympic action had turned <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/search?q=london+%22ghost+town%22" target="_blank">London into a "ghost town"</a>. Exaggerations, you might think, but <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/201281181349433184.html" target="_blank">Al Jazeera scientifically proved them true</a>. By aiming a camera at a Piccadily Circus tube entrance. For ten full minutes! Needless to say local entrepreneurs are <a href="http://http://www.cityam.com/forum/why-boris-owes-me-90000-olympic-damage" target="_blank">furious</a>.</p>
<p>As a generally unproductive citizen of London, I have other concerns. Forget loss of revenue, my worries are way more existential. If London has become an Olympic Ghost Town, what does that make us who're still here? Have we become ghosts ourselves? Have the spirits of past Olympians descended upon us, using our earthly bodies to roam New Olympia? Maybe I've been taken over by Jesse Owens' ghost... At least that would explain this sudden urge to grab my ghost chains and go haunt Nick Griffin's house.</p>
<p>But no.</p>
<p><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/uk-england-london-19150249" target="_blank">Truth is that London is not a ghost town.</a> The only thing the Olympics did, is move the city center from Charing Cross to Stratford, and replace Piccadily Circus with the Velodrome. So why all the fuzz? Well, it fills papers I suppose. <a href="http://www.distilledmagazine.com/blog/">And blogs</a>.</p>
