<p>You may have overheard, while waiting in line for your morning cuppa at Starbucks, that ideology has dead. It died last night of asphyxiation (best not to ask too many details), and was laid to rest besides the wreckage of the 20th century. Oh sure a few old fogeys at the funerals had a good cry, reminiscing to the demure pall-bearers about that one time they and ideology threw a war while their parents were away on holiday. About that one summer where they just hung around their L.E.S. apartment smoking up and writing manifestos.</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/grand-old-marxists">post</a> at the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/www.nybooks.com">New York Review of Books</a>, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Timothy_Snyder">Timothy Snyder</a> (who recently worked with the late Tony Judt on an excellent <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348500901&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=thinking+the+20th+century">abbreviated history</a> of political thought in the 20th century) by describing the striking similarity between your granddaddy's <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Marxism">Marxism</a>, and your eccentric uncle's <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Friedrich_hayek">Hayekian</a>/<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Ayn_rand">Randian</a> dogma punctures the hype about the death of ideology. According to Snyder, the Marxists and their free-market foes happen to share a few common threads:</p>
<ul>
<li>the idea that politics is a matter of finding and promoting one simple truth,</li>
<li>that the state will eventually wither away,</li>
<li>and that a vanguard of intellectuals must be the ones who bring about the utopia for the simpletons.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Marxism has provided the intellectual ballast for central planning, and Free-marketism has supported the dispersion of capital into private hands, there are many ways their failings are the same. Rather than planning by state bureaucrats, we have planning by private bureaucrats. Rather than one enormous socialist kingdom, we have several warring socialist fiefdoms (Try telling your libertarian friends about how corporations are model socialist organizations â€“ Hello Walmart!). Rather than elites selected by a crooked civil hierarchy, we have elites selected by corrupted private hierarchies. It seems that as private corporations become larger they tend to supersede the functions of the state, and not in a good way. As was often said about Communism, and now said for American Conservatism:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Conservatism cannot fail, it can only be failed."</p></blockquote>
<p>The ascension of Mitt Romney to the Republican nomination is the apotheosis of the rise of money in American democratic politics. Money and economic policy has always been a factor in elections, but it could be counterbalanced by other factors such as candidate appeal, media, the tide, etc. But in a system where the state dies a slow death under the 'post-ideology' ideology of free-market late capitalism, money knocks all other determinants of power out of the civic colosseum. It was inevitable that the money will just take what was theirs, and forget about the sweet-natured passionate fools who were their fronts. Hence Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.</p>
<p>If we don't acknowledge the intense of ideology of our post-ideological brethren, then we have no means of truly engaging with them in the public discourse.</p>
