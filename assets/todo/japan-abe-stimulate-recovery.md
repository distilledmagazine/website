<p>Although I would never encourage experimentation on more than 125 million citizens merely for curiosity’s sake, Japan is threatening to do the world a great disservice if it hedges too soon on its economic policies. The question sparking our curiosity is a fundamental one: can a country pull itself all the way out of a deep stagnation by simultaneously holding fast to strongly expansionary fiscal policy and strongly expansionary monetary policy?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reentered Japanese politics last year determined to make sweeping reforms. Focusing on the first two arrows of his “three-arrow strategy”, boosting public spending and expansionary monetary policy, Abe has lit a fire under the Japanese economy. Japan’s first quarter growth was recently <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/1994706-japan-economic-growth-upgraded-will-likely-outperform-other-advanced-nations" target="_blank">upgraded to an annualized rate of 4.1%</a>, outperforming other advanced countries in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>By committing to a higher inflation target and increasing the money supply, Japan has also been able to loosen the hold of the strong yen. A strong yen strangles the Japanese economy by making its exports too expensive to buy abroad. With a weaker currency automatically comes cheaper export prices. As Abe’s policies took hold, the exchange rate soared (marking a weakened yen) moving from below 78 yen per dollar on October 1, 2012 to over 103 yen per dollar on May 23, 2013. This is a 32% shift, coupled with fiscal stimulus has put Japan on a track that has not been seen in two decades.</p>
<p class="break">Nevertheless, there is reason for concern. From its peak above 103, the exchange rate steadily fell through June, marking a partial reversal of the weakened yen. The market has grown concerned that the Bank of Japan would get cold feet and not keep its commitments to sharply expansionary monetary policy as a recovery begins to take hold. Long-term inflation expectations remain near 1%, despite the Bank of Japan committing to bring inflation up to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/?p=3624" target="_blank">its target of 2%</a>. Simply put, the market is hesitant to believe that the Bank of Japan will follow through to the extent of its promise.</p>
<p>Pulling back too soon is a common problem in economic history. As expansionary policies begin to take hold, better economic results make it more difficult to argue for strong action. Seeing a strong recovery in 1936, Franklin Roosevelt and Congress famously moved to balance the United States budget, rather than continue expansionary spending, which plunged the country back into recession. It was only in the buildup to World War II, with its corresponding increased spending and expansionary monetary policy (via war bonds, etc.) that the Great Depression came to an end.</p>
<p class="break">This brings us back to our original question: can we climb out of recession by committing strongly to both expansionary monetary and fiscal policy? World War II is an example of greatly expansive fiscal and monetary policy pulling the United States, and the world in general, out of a deep depression.</p>
<p>That doesn't fully answer our question though. A world war is not a usual economic policy, and it comes with many economic features that would be difficult to recreate outside of the war context. Certainly, the prospect of a 1% unemployment rate, even while bringing new workers into the workforce or stoking the patriotic fervor of war bonds, would be difficult to mimic without the threat and inspiration of a war. Working together, expansive enough policies can bring a country out of a deep economic depression, but can a country create “expansive enough” policies without the impetus of a war?</p>
<p>There is good reason to believe that this is possible. The argument has been bolstered by Japan’s large early successes coupled with Europe’s recession and shameful unemployment rate after its move to contractionary austerity. Nonetheless, we are looking to Japan to show that it is possible. Much as Japan’s financial crisis foreshadowed the global financial crisis, its recovery can foreshadow a global recovery. Now is no time for cold feet.</p>
