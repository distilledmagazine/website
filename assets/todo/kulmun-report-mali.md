<p style="text-align: justify;">To explain the insurgency in Northern Mali as a battle between the central government and the rebellious force of Azawad would be an understatement. The rebel groups themselves, for example, are torn between the Islamist, Al-Qaeda affiliates: Ansar Dine, Boko Haram, MOJWA, Ansar Al-Sharia, and AQIM, and the secular, secessionist National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA). Meanwhile, the central authority in the capital Bamako is struggling with its interim government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/le-mali.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3376" alt="le-mali" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/le-mali-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>Before the coup d’états in 2012, the former French colony had always been among the leading democracies in Africa. Its 1992 constitution guarantees civil rights and freedom: “All Malians are born and live free and equal in their rights and duties [...] Any discrimination based on social origin, color, language [...] is prohibited.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The country held peaceful presidential elections in 1997, 2002, and 2007, and as per 2006, Bamako was one of the fastest growing cities in the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The callings for an independent Azawad have existed since 1962, but the crisis in Libya following the fall of Khaddafi has advanced the insurgency. “Many heavily armed Tuareg fighters returned [from Libya] to Mali,” said Ms. Annette Lohmann, head of the Friedrich-Ebert-Foundation in Mali to German media Deutsche Welle. From a scarcely armed militia, these rebels have become a real threat to regional security.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After capturing the three largest cities in Northern Mali, Kidal, Gao, and Timbuktu, the alliance of the rebels broke and the MNLA was expelled from their newly acquired territory. The Islamists then started to impose a strict interpretation of Sharia law, including death by stoning and the banning of Western pop culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Islamists advanced and captured the strategically important city of Konna, alarming President Dioncounda Traoré — who turned to the French for help. On January 11, 2013, President François Hollande resolved to send 2,500 French troops in addition to the 750 others who were already deployed to its ex-colony’s soil. The intervention was also logistically and publicly supported by the United States, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, and Canada.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Albeit ‘impromptu’, the French government’s action was applauded by the UN, the European Union, the ECOWAS, and the African Union. “Mali has seven borders with a whole series of countries,” French Foreign Ministers Mr. Laurent Fabius reminded the press, “if you add one country, it links Mali to the Mediterranean, and then to Europe.”. It was that particular fear of spillover that led the UN Secretary-General Mr. Ban Ki-Moon to remark that the French action was necessary to help restoring “Mali’s constitutional order and territorial integrity.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Critics, on the other hand, have accused the French as having neo-colonialist intentions. Mr. John Laughland of the Paris Institute of Democracy and Co-operation argued: “[French action in Mali]… is a general trend of intervention in Africa. And minerals count.” Mali is Africa’s third largest gold producer, and is rich of lithium, bitumen schist, lignite, rock salt, and diatomite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And then there exists the classic intervention dilemma. In the words of Mr. Joseph Nye: motives of interventions are often mixed. It also goes without saying that the public won’t likely have complete access to the French administration’s decision-making process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, the real question might not be about the intervention or its legitimacy, rather its aftermath. The operation did enable the Malian government to gain the captured cities from the hand of the Islamists rebels, but preventing future Islamist insurgency calls for long-term stability in Mali and the whole Sahel region. In this respect, the EU’s initiative to provide military training for the Malian army should be appreciated. France should also ensure a smooth transition from the French army to the ECOWAS and African Union.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the French aerial strikes pushing the Islamists to hide among the civilians, the French might be threatened with a Vietnam-like situation. With prudence, France should avoid turning Mali into a quagmire.</p>
