<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>On February 13<sup>th </sup>, it will have exactly been one year since Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, President and ‘Protector’ (<i>Arkadag) </i>of Turkmenistan was re-elected with a staggering 97% of total votes cast in his favour. All other seven appointed candidates congratulated Mr. Berdymukhamedov on his great victory, praising his leadership skills. Mr. Berdymukhamedov had every right to be pleased: he had improved his previous top score of 89%. Needless to say that opacity, corruption, back-room dealings and a dismal human rights track record are the name of the game in the most reclusive of all Central Asian ‘-stans’. Think North Korea, but with camels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Berdymukhamedov is the successor to the deceased President Saparmurat Niyazov, who had proclaimed himself ‘Father of all Turkmens’ (<i>Turkmenbashi</i>). Never one to step down from a challenge, Berdymukhamedov’s cult of personality is fast catching up with the late Niyazov’s twenty-year legacy of egomaniacal tendencies.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Niyazov’s strokes of inspiration had included renaming the month of January after himself, April after his mother, and September after his self-written spiritual guide (<i>Ruhnama</i>) which was mandatory literature for the resource-rich Caspian nation of 5 million. To top it all off, a golden statue of Turkmenbashi was erected which revolved so that its face was always facing the sun, courtesy of French construction firm Bouygues. Amongst his many accomplishments, he downgraded the educational system, confiding that it was easier to rule an illiterate nation, and closed most of the medical facilities, a task which was  dilligently carried out by Berdymukhamedov, minister of Health at that time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">President Berdymukhamedov has since restored the proper names of the months and has replaced the ubiquitous portraits of the late Turkmenbashi with portraits of himself, updated on a yearly basis. Statues and paintings of his heroic deeds are created in a rapid fashion. In addition, he can be found racing (and winning) sports car races around Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan. He relaxes by sitting on his $50 million yacht floating in the Caspian Sea, a generous gift from Russian oil company Itera. He was rumored to have been slightly unhappy about the fact that the yacht was not as big as the one owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, just who is Gurbanguly Berdimukhamedov? Apparently, he’s a dentist. ‘Berdy’ is the only son in a family of eight children. His father was a prison guard, his mother a housewife. He graduated from the dental faculty of the Turkmen State Medical Institute and started work as a dentist in the capital. He steadily rose through the ranks, studying in Moscow, and in 1997 was appointed minister of Health, allowing him to learn the intricacies of Turkmen politics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He is married to a Turkmen wife with whom he has three children, and has had a long standing extramarital affair with a Russian nurse, Marina, with whom he has one daughter. He met her whilst still practising dentistry. Turkmeni people in exile state that Berdymukhamedov himself may actually be the extramarital son of Niyazov, thus explaining his sudden rise to the top and knack for crackpot ideas. It is a case of where reality truly does trump fiction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leaked US embassy cables present a stunningly unflattering description of ‘Berdy’s’ personality: he is “vain, suspicious, guarded, strict, vindictive, a practised liar, a micromanager” and “he dislikes people which are smarter than him” (he himself is described as not being very smart). In short, he ticks all the right boxes for dictator material.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the death of Turkmenbashi in 2006, Turkmenistan’s Security Council named Berdymukhamedov as successor, a political move which greatly surprised both the domestic and international political community. Allegedly, the Security Council had perceived ‘Berdy’ as a weak and easy to manipulate political figure. In hindsight probably the biggest miscalculation of that council ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whilst at first keeping a low profile, he has been systematically beefing up his image as Father of the Nation via 24/7 national broadcasts on radio and television. State control of the country’s 5 TV stations, 25 newspapers and 15 magazines is absolute. International television is first censored before being relayed to domestic viewers, and internet usage is feverishly monitored via a highly censored version of the Web known as Turkmenet. It is unknown how many activists or journalists are currently imprisoned in psychiatric hospitals or prisons, yet with a position in the bottom three of the Free Press Index 2012, it is safe to say that there are probably quite a few not-so-free journalists, political opponents and human rights activists. Nevertheless, his books continue to dominate the Turkmen bestsellers lists.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Turkmenistan’s natural gas reserves are estimated to be the fourth largest in the world. The country is effectively sitting on a bubble of gold, with a pipeline being built to India, China and Europe, allowing all of the parties to avoid having to deal with the Russians, albeit indirectly, as over two-thirds of all natural gas is exported by the Russian company Gazprom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">President Berdymukhamedov has stressed that gas export to Europe is of critical importance to the Turkmen foreign policy. This is perhaps why the EU mostly turns a blind eye on the gross abuse of civil liberties. Berdymukhamedov has masterfully played out Turkish, Iranian, Chinese, Russian, US and European investors out against each other, each of them vying for a piece of the gas-action, effectively ending a twenty-year long isolation from the rest of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, while the country may be opening up to investors, the question remains as to where all this gas revenue is going. The answer is as strikingly simple as it is deplorable: The State Agency for the Management and Use of Hydrocarbon Resources, under the direct control by the President. Over 80% of the profits dissapear into murky shadow economy, propped up by laws created by the President himself via Executive Orders. This essentially gives Berdymukhamedov control over the country’s oil and gas coffers, and ensures that the People of Turkmenistan, with over half of the population living below the poverty line, see nothing of the wealth created by the sale of Turkmeni natural resources. The West chooses to ignore this problem for the time being, as it needs Turkmen support for the NATO operations in Afghanistan and an alternative to buying gas from that other supplier, Russia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the long run, this is a classic problem which will cause enormous economic problems in the future when the gas and oil reserves will start to dwindle, as the economy is not in a stage of diversification necessary for ensuring future prosperity and there is no proper form of an effective government necessary to steer the country in some kind direction. Turkmenistan will have no cash, no resources and no critical intellectual mass. ‘Berdy’ will be long gone by then.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With recent uprisings in the Arab world, dictator after dictator is falling. Those dictators that remain  nervously shuffle in their chair, anxious to avoid being cast in the international spotlight. The fall of a despotic regime does not necessarily mean that the next leader is immediately better, nor does it mean that  the transition to a more liberal democratic society is a one day affair. It does however prove that persistent popular pressure is an effective instrument in overthrowing or destabilising any kind of despotic regime. Turkmenistan is a country which is not on the radar of the Western media, one can hope that this may soon change and that Turkmens may wake up and seek an alternative to the oppressive regime of Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov.</p>
