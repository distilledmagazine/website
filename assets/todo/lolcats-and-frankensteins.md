<p>Time for a little Distilled quiz. Is the creature pictured beneath...</p>
<p>A) An innocent, untouched lolcat?<br />
B) A genetically modified Frankenstein?</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1178" align="alignnone" width="275"]<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/seigboardbest.pl?4864:9"><img class="size-full wp-image-1178" title="lolcat" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/lolcat.jpg" width="275" height="400" /></a> http://www.catsthatlooklikehitler.com[/caption]</p>
<p>And the winner is... B!</p>
<p>Not that I'm accusing Kitty's owner (<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/seigboardbest.pl?4864:9">that's her actual name</a>) of genetically modifying her to look more like Hitler. No, it just couldn't be A, because there is no such thing as a genetically untouched cat. The domestic cat <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/results?search_type=videos&amp;search_query=lolcat&amp;search_sort=video_view_count">as we know it</a> genetically diverged from the wildcat because it evolved <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Cat#Taxonomy_and_evolution">to adapt to life in human settlements</a>. And dog lovers, before you start gloating, this difference is even more obvious with you canine darlings, as <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Dog#History_and_evolution">a wild dog is what one might more colloquially call "a wolf"</a>.</p>
<p>This is something we should keep in mind when discussing modern forms of genetic manipulation. Cats, dogs, cows, pigs, domestic goats, sheep... Almost every animal at the petting zoo is in fact genetically modified by mankind to suit its needs. And this not only applies to animals. Nearly all plants that end up on our plate are the result of a similar process of selection. Modern grain varieties have evolved from their wild ancestors into a species that can no longer procreate spontaneously; they need us to do it for them. (Read more on the relation between domestication and evolution <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/books?id=OwVrSMQPPowC&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Sure, in all these cases we're talking about processes carried out by unknowing humans over several millennia, rather than the fully conscious experiments of today. But that doesn't fundamentally change the argument: genetic manipulation in itself is not "immoral" or "evil". It's the norm.<br />

<p>We should keep that in mind when evaluating the recent controversy surrounding the agriculture multinational Monsanto, on discussion in this video:</p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7DqaJ3QgHU</p>
<p>The message of this video can be broken down into three main accusations. Let's evaluate each of these seperately.</p>
<p><em>1. The genetically modified corn marketed by Monsanto is dangerous.</em> It is very tempting to scare people into believing publishing sensationalist pictures of test rats with visible tumours. It's also very easy to accuse every scientist with a different conclusion of being sponsored by Monsanto. Fact is that <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/467">among the sceptics is the independent British NGO Society of Biology</a>, so this is just not true. Which means that on this accusation, the academic jury is still out.<br />
<strong><strong>Verdict: NOT PROVEN</strong></strong></p>
<p><em>2. The deregulation of potentially dangerous new technologies is immoral.<strong> </strong></em>This accusation goes to the actual root of the problem. It's very sensible to argue that new products like GM corn shouldn't be marketed at all before the academic dispute is resolved. In this light, deregulations that remove this requirement are wrong. Both the companies asking for it and the government executing these demands are to be held responsible.<br />
<strong>Verdict: GUILTY</strong></p>
<p><em>3. The misuse of patent monopolies to quadruple prices is downright evil.<strong> </strong></em>The practice of making people pay ridiculously high prices for your patented product, while at the same time depriving them of alternatives, is of course immoral. But this is <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/apple-versus-samsung">not exclusive to the GM business</a>. The difference between Apple and Monsanto though, is that its obviously a lot worse to rip of poor Indian farmers, than to fool <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/watch?v=BMsLArefSOw" target="_blank">gullible, affluent hipsters</a>.<br />
<strong>Verdict: GUILTY</strong></p>
<p>What we shouldn't do is blame these evils on genetic manipulation itself. Technological innovation is not evil. It is a fact of life that asks for political and social solutions.</p>
