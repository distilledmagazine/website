<p>Hello Distillers. We are happy to announce the much anticipated weeklong release of issue IV of the magazine. Please join us for this weeklong magazine release. The theme of the magazine is <em>The Art of the Possible.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Art of the</em> Possible, where we plumb the depths of the question: "How do we develop a move­ment that turns prin­ci­ples into real­ity?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"> <em>Politics and the Power of Love</em> by Tobias Schaffner</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tobias is a liberal Aristotelian-Thomist, studying at Pembroke College, University of Cambridge.  He is currently writing up his doctoral dissertation on the legal and moral philosophy of the Jesuit Francisco Suarez and hopes to start a grassroots movement together with all those who are prepared to publicly affirm an ethical way of living.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Preview <em>Politics and the Power of Love</em>:</strong> There is a demise of love and friendship in public discourse. Modern governance should move beyond the limits of justice, freedom, and prosperity to again embrace our human connection to love.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Don't Click the Guilt Away</em> by Yasmine Colijn</p>
<p dir="ltr">Yasmine Colijn is finishing an MSc. in International Politics at Trinity College Dublin. She's moving to Tanzania soon to pursue her ambition of working in development aid and continue a life of traveling. She tweets over at @colijny</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Preview <em>Don't Click the Guilt Away:</em></strong> There is a deep chasm with the possibilities and the reality of online activism. With one simple click of a mouse, we can now ’like‘ or ’share‘ information from advocacy groups and NGOs and wipe our guilty consciences clean. If anything, online activism has become the end, rather than the means.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Aim for the Impossible</em> by David Cichon</p>
<p dir="ltr">-David Cichon holds a degree in Engineering and International Development from the University of Sussex and is currently completing an MSc in International Politics at Trinity College, Dublin. His research focuses on trade unions' and worker's rights abuses within the global economy. He hopes to pursue his research as part of global worker's rights campaigns</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Preview <em>Aim for the Impossible</em></strong>: Challenging the logic of capitalism does not have to mean challenging the logic of human rights and individual freedoms. If we accept that the logic of the global political and economic system is responsible for creating much of the poverty, inequality, exclusion and injustices that we see around us, then acting according to that  same logic to promote social change is not just a fallacy but a tragedy.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Is Libertarianism Impossible?</em> by Marcus Hunt</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Marcus Hunt just completed a BA in Philosophy and Politics at Trinity College Dublin, and is about to embark upon an MA in Philosophy at Queen’s College Belfast. His primary interests lie in the philosophy of history.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Preview <em>Is Libertarianism Impossible?</em></strong>  There are a group of people who cause me distress. I call these people Libertarians. Libertarianism is corrosive to society’s well-being because it prevents us from taking rational collective action and throw us all back upon our own meager resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Restoring "America the Brave"</em> by Rob Ivory</p>
<p dir="ltr">-Rob Ivory graduated from The Clinton Institute, UCD in 2012 with a masters degree in American Studies. He holds a B.A. in Economics and English, and currently works for University College Dublin</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Preview <em>Restoring "America the Brave"</em></strong> The rise of China has spearheaded a rapidly developing group of countries to challenge the US in economic terms. Terrorism and non-state actors have presented America with security and foreign-policy challenges that test the very principles of the nation.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Energy: A Deadlock for Humanity?</em> by Maciek Hacaga</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maciek Hacaga is a grad­u­ate from the Lon­don School of Economics</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Preview<em> Energy: A Deadlock for Humanity?</em></strong> Energy has become a “hot topic” in recent years. From green energy over climate change and geopolitics to the unaddressed and growing needs of the emerging countries, it is an issue that has been discussed all over the world. To escape the crash course set out by our, not always wise,  activities we are advised to start looking for alternative patterns of development.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em> European Perspectives for Ukraine</em> by Martyna Koska</p>
<p dir="ltr">-Martyna Koska is an analyst, journalist, and blogger based in Warsaw. She specializes in International Relations and Eastern European affairs.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Preview <em>European Perspectives for Ukraine</em></strong> : What will come of the 2013 EU-Ukrainian summit?  For the benefit of both sides, the European Union and Ukraine should work past their obstacles to complete an Association Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>An Interview with Ambassador Neelam Deo</em> by Bram De Ridder</p>
<p dir="ltr">-Bram De Ridder studied history at the University of Leuven (Belgium) and International Relations at the University of Cambridge (UK). During his studies he participated in numerous student-run political re-enactments (i.e. European Union) or debating groups. Currently he is a Research Fellow of the Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO), preparing a doctorate on Early Modern borders. Other research interests of his are Early Modern politics and law, peace studies, and international organization</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>An Interview with Ambassador Neelam Deo</strong></em>: A distinguished diplomat, Neelam Deo has been the Indian Ambassador to Denmark and Ivory Coast with concurrent accreditation to several West African countries.

<p dir="ltr"><em>Terrorism as Performance Art</em> by Brecht Savelkoul</p>
<p dir="ltr">Brecht Savelkoul is Managing Editor at Distilled Magazine. He studied Global History at the London School of Economics and Modern History at the University of Leuven. Find him on Twitter <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BrSav89">@BrSav89</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Preview</strong> <strong><em>Terrorism as Performance Art</em></strong>:  "The greatest work of art that has ever existed." That was Karl-Heinz Stockhausen's unfortunate description of 9/11, only six days after the fact. Even though he's been understandably ostracised for it, we should forgive him. It is much more interesting, challenging, and indeed instructive to view terrorist attacks as art, rather than seeing them as acts of war.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"> <em>We Are the Possible</em> by Maja Falkentoft</p>
<p dir="ltr">-Maja Felicia Falkentoft has previously completed studies and internships in both Montréal and Dakar, but is currently finishing her degree in Global Studies at Roskilde University in Denmark. When not studying, Maja is practicing her interest in issues of sociopolitical and global character as an organizer of the yearly Copenhagen-based Danish Model UN conference</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Preview <em>We Are the Possible</em></strong>: For individuals, moral principles are often defined as universal claims to "right" and "wrong". In practise this can easily lead to excess, for instance in the disintegration of diverse societies. Instead we should apply to individuals the prevalent morality of international relations: let each be sovereign in his/her own right. After all, our mere existence is something naturally positive.</p>
