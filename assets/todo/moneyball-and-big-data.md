<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-3785fe94-5210-98f8-6e3f-a62aca74edcc">Billy Beane, general manager of the Oakland Athletics and subject of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Moneyball_The_Art_of_Winning_an_Unfair_G.html?id=oIYNBodW-ZEC" target="_blank">Moneyball</a>, often says that baseball is a zero-sum game, i.e. preventing a run is the same as hitting a <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120723&amp;content_id=35425936&amp;vkey=perspectives&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb" target="_blank">home run</a>.  His reasoning is anti-intuitive and obvious all at the same time.  If the intention of baseball is to score more runs than the other team, then it is just as valuable to prevent a run as it is to score a run.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, as with many anti-intuitive insights born from economics and applied to new fields, it is wrong.  For reasons just as obvious as equating a run scored and a run prevented, it misses the entire point of the original intuition and ignores an entire branch of economics.  Baseball is not a zero-sum game, and the value of a home run is not entirely captured in its impact on the scoreboard.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Billy Beane is no stranger to economics.  His director of baseball operations, Farhan Zaidi, holds a Ph.D. from Berkeley.  <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Paul_DePodesta" target="_blank">Paul DePodesta</a>, co-inventor of the Moneyball strategy and former assistant general manager with the A’s had a degree in economics from Harvard.  Looking through Beane’s staff with the A’s looks more like a social science grad school than a typical baseball staff, with degrees in political science, sociology, and finance – all professions with a keen interest in applying the lessons of advanced statistics to social systems.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As outlined in the hit Moneyball book and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank">movie</a>, Beane used this brain trust and a keen understanding of statistics to find traits of players that were undervalued or overvalued in the market.  Moneyball focused on undervalued walks (measured by on-base percentage) and overvalued closers (measured by saves).  Buying undervalued and selling overvalued players allowed Beane to compete throughout the early 2000s, even with his payroll orders of magnitude less than the giants of New York and Boston.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Not surprisingly for followers of finance, these strategies were quickly adopted by his competitors elsewhere in baseball, both in terms of correcting values and applying advanced statistics, and the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/the-economics-moneyball" target="_blank">advantage gained by following them disappeared</a>.  It is a fundamental trait of competitive markets that any easily-understood strategy shown to beat a market will be quickly priced into the market so that its profits disappear.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beane and DePodesta are not fools.  They know that they must stay ahead of the curve to <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/rejecting-best-practices-baseball-billy-beane-paul-depodesta" target="_blank">continue to find undervalued statistics in the baseball market</a>. This is where valuing defense comes in.  By placing emphasis on measuring defense with advanced statistics (under the theory that traditional scouts overvalue offense), the next generation of “undervalued statistics” entered the market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">I have seen this strategy in practice following my hometown team, the Seattle Mariners, who had decided that defensive players were undervalued by the market.  Following advanced metrics and the principle that a run saved is a run earned, the Mariners loaded up with top defenders in 2010, believing that defensive players were undervalued even with paltry offensive production.  The Mariners established themselves as the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/31" target="_blank">top defensive team in baseball that year</a>, and promptly placed <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/#20101003" target="_blank">last in the American League</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">These were certainly not the results promised by advanced analysis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">For anyone well-versed in economic theory, this result should be just as unsurprising.  This is a classic example of an<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Externality" target="_blank"> externality or an external cost</a>.  Even though baseball is a ripe area for statistical analysis (because of its countless semi-independent observations), it relies on the idea that we can measure any meaningful result in its impact on the play.  If a play has an impact on a subsequent play, then it will be missed in the data and underestimated.  This impact on the subsequent play is an external cost because it is external to the original transaction, the original player’s at bat.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">These external costs were obvious in the Mariners 2010 season.  The fact that so many weak offensive players were collected into a single team was soul-sucking.  As the team limped to the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/story?id=5584763&amp;sportCat=mlb" target="_blank">worst offensive performance in decades</a>, it was obvious that any one player’s performance was affecting the others in a meaningfully negative way.  Playing without a spark of hope brings everyone down.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is why baseball is not a zero-sum game and why managing a baseball team is not simply finding players that seem undervalued by your advanced metrics.  It is incredibly difficult to find external costs and benefits in statistics.  Statistical analysis cannot measure the fear and hope of Casey at the bat, whose effect on the game ripples through human experience even if it ultimately ends in a disappointing strikeout.  That fear and hope causes pitchers to pitch more carefully and batters to bear down, all in hopes of making that one moment more significant when the great hope comes to the plate.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Clung to the hope which springs eternal in the human</p>
<p dir="ltr">breast;</p>
<p dir="ltr">They thought, “If only Casey could but get a whack at that—</p>
<p dir="ltr">We'd put up even money now, with <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/15500#sthash.FVisLSpA.dpuf" target="_blank">Casey at the bat</a>.” [/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a zero-sum game, one team’s loss is exactly another team's gain, but that is not the case in baseball.  A home run gives a team unquantifiable hope moving forward, as the days of the season stretch to months.  Simply put, a great defensive play does not ripple the same way.  A run saved is a run saved, but no one laces up their cleats hoping that today is the day that their shortstop improves his defensive range.  Baseball players, like economic actors, are people, whose performance improves or suffers with the introduction of hope and confidence.  Assembling a good team is not and cannot be merely the accumulation of the most “wins above replacement” because home runs and defensive plays are not interchangeable based on their impact on the game at hand.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, economists have a ready-made solution to this statistical shortfall.  Simply assume that such interactions do not exist and that <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/refuting-greg-mankiw" target="_blank">people are unaffected by successes and failures</a>.  Unfortunately, unlike <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/03/remembering-the-wrongness" target="_blank">economists</a>, general managers get fired when their predictions do not come to fruition.</p>
