<p style="text-align: justify;">Last week I was having a drink at a London bar near Charing Cross in the excellent company of Distilled colleague <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/author/michal/" target="_blank">Michal Zuk</a>. Talking about plans for the forthcoming week, I asked him to join me to the new Quentin Tarantino movie <em>Django Unchained</em>. He didn't just refuse. He objected, with reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In many ways the setup of Django Unchained echoes that of Tarantino's previous film. <em>Inglourious Basterds</em> told the story of a fictional Jewish squadron in World War II. Tarantino sent them on a killing spree behind German lines, thus turning history upside-down. Historical victims become on-screen torturers, as witnessed in an early scene where the Basterds <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/watch?v=HTqYbzuCEYs" target="_blank">interrogate a German officer</a>. The <em>Wehrmacht </em>sergeant — not SS, an <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/what-is-the-difference-between-the-german-army-gestapo-nazi-party-sa-ss-and-wehrmacht.htm" target="_blank">important detail</a> — refuses to give away the positions of his soldiers and pays for it with his life. Staging this cold-blooded execution of an honourable Nazi by a Jewish squadron makes Tarantino "either immoral or an idiot".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Touché, but I beg to differ. As I still haven't seen Django — rather than continuing the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/253170364606205952" target="_blank">fine journalistic tradition</a> of using Twitter to write about it anyway — I'll base my argument on Tarantino's prior work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[youtube="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD5duzcNKxM&amp;w=270"]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My starting point: Tarantino movies aren't about <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/5-ways-you-dont-realize-movies-are-controlling-your-brain" target="_blank">"good guys" vs. "bad guys"</a>. Can you name me one good guy in <em>Reservoir Dogs</em>? A single villain in <em>Pulp Fiction</em>? (If you feel the uncontrollable urge to answer these rhetorical question, that's what article comment section is for. Need a bigger platform? We'd gladly publish all your <a href="mailto:editor@distilledmagazine.com" target="_blank">letters to the editor</a>.)  Similarly, reducing <em>Inglourious Basterds </em>to a struggle between protagonists and antagonists is very restrictive perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don't limit your experience to the big screen though. There are antagonists. Tarantino follows a long dramatic tradition going back to Bertolt Brecht of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Experimental_theatre#Relationships_to_audience" target="_blank">involving the audience</a>. In Inglourious Basterds he took this to a new extreme, making us viewers the antagonist — think comedian vs. heckler.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And the protagonist? Reading Tarantino's oeuvre as one big story, it becomes a Bildungsroman of personified Violence. In Reservoir Dogs we saw its <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Great_Lives_Series_26_Thomas_Hobbes" target="_blank">Hobbesian face</a>: a calculated attack (the robbery), pre-emptive strikes (altercations in the warehouse), and honor-driven revenge ("Stuck in the Middle with You"). Two years later, Pulp Fiction showed how violence can <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/john-gray-steven-pinker-violence-review" target="_blank">become a way of life</a>. Finally, in <em>Kill Bill</em> it turns <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bad-seeds" target="_blank">sadist</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inglourious Basterds added a new dimension to the plot. Submitting to Godwin's Law (<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/godwin-law-egypt/" target="_blank">something I applaud</a>), the story takes a moral turn. A Right vs. Wrong struggle erupts between the Audience and on-screen Violence. Crowds who came in scarred by 9/11-style terrorism cheered when a Jewish woman suicide bombed a theatre full of Nazis. Just like that, Tarantino turned us from careful observers into a blood-thirsty mob.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A crowd of people is always a bit like R.L. Stevenson's <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde#Dr_Henry_Jekyll_.2F_Mr_Edward_Hyde" target="_blank">Dr Jekyll</a>. Kind and benevolent at best, but with the sinister Mr Hyde always lurking in the background. Inglourious Basterds successfully provoked our internal Mr Hyde. Let's all go and watch Django, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/quentin-tarantino-newtown-violence-disrespectful_n_24089031.html" target="_blank">without falling into the same trap again</a>.</p>
