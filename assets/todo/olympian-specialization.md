<p>I'm heartbroken. <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/uk-19236754">The Olympics are now over</a>. The Paralympics (or as I call it, the World's Coolest Cyborg Competition) are too far away.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_56" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/800px-Olympic_mascots_cropped.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-56" title="800px-Olympic_mascots_(cropped)" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/800px-Olympic_mascots_cropped-300x2241.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a> From Department of Culture, Media, and Sport under the Open Government License v1.0 http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/[/caption]</p>
<p>What am I to do with this swelling of pride for my country and the nations of the world?</p>
<p>Where do we, the international community, go now to cultivate greater harmony among the peoples of our lonely planet?</p>
<p>Simple. In much the same way tiny Jamaica can specialize to produce track supermen, and Kazakhstan can breed extraordinary weightlifters, maybe countries can also specialize in goods and services.</p>
<p>The concept of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Comparative_advantage">comparative advantage</a> demands that nations specialize in order to achieve the greatest total net gains from trade. Henceforth, Cuba will produce the world's cigars, Mongolia will produce the world's fermented yak milk, Russia will produce the world's nested dolls, and Papua New Guinea in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/experts-recommend-australia-deport-asylum-seekers-to-malaysia-papua-new-guinea-and-nauru/2012/08/13/bade7de2-e50b-11e1-9739-eef99c5fb285_story.html">asylum camp services</a>.</p>

<p>Wait, asylum camps in New Guinea?</p>
<p><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/oceania-map.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-57" title="oceania-map" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/oceania-map-300x2681.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="268" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Julia_gillard">Julia Gillard</a>, current Prime Minister of Australia and reigning champ of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Australian_Labor_Party_leadership_election,_2012">Labor Party leadership politics</a>, recently advocated the reinstatement of policies first deployed under a Conservative administration to deport potential asylum seekers to Papua New Guinea and the microscopic island nation of Nauru.</p>
<p>Via the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/experts-recommend-australia-deport-asylum-seekers-to-malaysia-papua-new-guinea-and-nauru/2012/08/13/bade7de2-e50b-11e1-9739-eef99c5fb285_story.html">Washington Post</a>, she attempts to justify her shift away from Labor's long-standing opposition to the Conservative deportation policy:</p>
<blockquote><p>When our nation looks at what is happening at sea as people attempt dangerous journeys to Australia, too many lives have been lost and I’m not going to play politics or look at political scoreboards when too many lives have been lost.</p></blockquote>
<p>The policy itself was endorsed by a panel of independent experts before being forwarded to Cabinet and the PM for approval. In a somewhat deft move Gillard has also waylaid the opposition</p>
<blockquote><p>Opposition immigration spokesman Scott Morrison welcomed the report as an endorsement of his party’s policies. But he did not promise the opposition support the government needs to pass the legislation through Parliament.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a nod to human rights concerns, former Australian Defense Force  Chief and head of the panel making these recommendations "said asylum seekers should spend less than five years in the Australian-commissioned camps."</p>
<p>Of course, there is no guarantee that once asylum seekers are off Australian shores that they will be treated with the full panoply of rights accorded to them by the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Convention_Relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees">UN Convention on Refugees</a>. Both Papua New Guinea and Nauru have expressed support for these conventions, but as with many slips of paper scribbled with the tenets of human rights, enforcement of these values is hard to come by in nations as poor as these two.</p>
<p>The relative poverty of both countries means that the influx of Australian money will be highly beneficial for the local economies. <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Papua_new_guinea">Papua New Guinea</a> is a mountainous nation of vast mineral and biological resources and the capacity to become wealthy given a functioning political class in Port Moresby. The country, however, is fractured among many languages, tribes, and local chieftains where politics is a far more parochial affair than in countries with a united national identity.</p>
<p>I find <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Nauru">Nauru</a> to be an even more interesting country in this story. Nauru was destroyed in the 20th century through aggressive phosphate strip-mining operations. Before that, the people of Nauru enjoyed a fantastic standard of living compared to their brethren in Oceania. In an effort to sustain itself, Nauru then became an offshore tax haven, a prime site for money-laundering, and a distributor of passports for a considerable price. Nauru in recent years has undertaken legislation to reform these practices,  but has since required something to fill the economic gap. Hence the detention center. It remains to be seen if the  Australian asylum camp will be any more sustainable than phosphate mining or money-laundering.</p>
<p>While the rude calculations of economics may favor the specialization of certain countries to certain industries, there is a limit. Essential components of the state that bear on the human rights of individuals (from any nation) and national security are far too critical from either a moral or sovereign viewpoint to be exported to other countries. What's next? Georgia for instance has <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CFgQFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.units.muohio.edu%2Fhavighurstcenter%2Fconferences%2Fdocuments%2FDiPuppo_paper.pdf&amp;ei=jEcqULzaLcit0QWmsoHQBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrbm-l6ZY9FFX0Vx1KDZhzA-G2kQ&amp;sig2=R0uWj5Liefk3_cfJaotwug">exported government services</a> to fight corruption. Gaddafi <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/SB10001424053111904199404576538721260166388.html">exported surveillance and monitoring</a> of Libyan citizens. The USA <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Extraordinary_rendition">exported the detention</a> and subsequent torture of 'enemy combatants' to Eastern Europe and Egypt.</p>
<p>Beyond the more obvious human rights issues, off-shoring are like holes drilled into a cruise ship. The first few ain't gonna make much of a difference. But eventually, you'll find your boat has sprung one too many leak. At that sinking point, there will be no way back.</p>
<p>So I say, let the Jamaicans have their track stars and the Canadians have their hockey and the Chinese have their table tennis (and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/search?aq=f&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=olympics+medals+table">everything else apparently</a>). Let's just not go overboard and let each other have bits and pieces of sovereignty, at least not without building a stronger foundation than mere economic expediency.</p>
