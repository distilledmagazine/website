<p>China’s long-held assertion of its ‘indisputable sovereignty’ over the South China Sea (SCS) is an increasing source of friction in Southeast Asia. This tension was on display in a recent spat with Vietnam over control of the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/21558262">Paracel Islands</a> and in a stand-off with the Philippines inside the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/china-and-the-philippines-navy">Scarborough Shoal</a>.</p>
<p>The maritime territorial dispute has gained international traction not only because of these skirmishes but also because of the attention that China’s efforts have garnered in Washington, leading to the recent suggestions that it is <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/south-china-sea">"fast becoming the focus of one of the most serious bilateral disputes between America and China."</a></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The contested area is a 1.3 million square mile section of the Pacific Ocean that lies between several ASEAN nations.<em> </em>Competing claims have been made by China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, and Taiwan. Relying on the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/sns-rt-us-china-sea-boundarybre84o075-20120524_1_beijing-and-manila-acrimonious-confrontation-south-china-sea">9-dash line map</a> that was first published in 1947 but based on historical maps from the Ming Dynasty, China has staked the largest claim that is essentially most of the SCS.</p>

<p>Conventional wisdom dictates that the conflict is rooted in controlling one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes and the potentially huge reserves of oil and natural gas. If the estimate of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/china-politics-oil-needs-risk-conflict-in-s-dot-china-sea">213 billion</a> barrels of oil proves accurate, it would make it the largest oil reserve outside of Saudi Arabia. An alternative perspective of the conflict however, is that it primarily revolves around a medley of swollen <a href="http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/east-asias-sea-disputes-scar-tissue-from-war-wounds">nationalist pride.</a></p>
<p>China, which surpassed the United States as the world’s largest energy consumer in 2010, recently affirmed its intention to settle the matter through peaceful bilateral negotiations with the relevant parties (read: not the United States). However, the question has been raised that if China actually is assured of its ‘indisputable sovereignty’, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/the-korean-war-meets-the-south-china-sea">what exactly is left to bargain over?</a> Also, because of its size and potential for <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/chinas-coercive-economic-diplomacy">coercive economic diplomacy,</a> the assumption is that any bilateral approach heavily favours China.</p>
<p>Washington entered the fray in earnest in 2010 when Hilary Clinton, citing a national interest in the outcome, boldly called on Beijing to allow her to help mediate a solution. For their part, China has shown little interest in such a multi-lateral result and blames the United States for taking sides in the territorial dispute and emboldening Vietnam and the Philippines, (two nations that greatly need to capitalize on the economic resources in the area) through renewed joint military exercises and drills.</p>
<p>Section 5 of the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/UNCLOS-TOC.htm">United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)</a> outlines the procedure for settling this type of dispute but China has refused to submit to arbitration because its claim predates the treaty. Yet the notorious American refusal to ratify the treaty (currently led by a group of 34 Senators who are on record as promising to vote against ratification), ironically <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/outlaw-of-the-sea">lends roundabout support</a> to the unilateralism and bilateralism that it now aims to eschew.</p>
<p>China’s assertions about its claim has grown alongside its mounting economic and geopolitical power. Analysts agree that while the dispute gives the United States a golden opportunity to further <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/p27883">re-establish itself</a> as a force in the region, the outcome of this dispute may be much more indicative of where China’s economic and military power stacks up.</p>
