<p>Amidst all the hubbub in UK politics today, we had the dumb(er) man's George Osborne, David Davis, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/cameron-cabinet-reshuffle-politics-live1#block-5044be0ac0e3d642e636f2d7">argue</a> for even harsher austerity policies, saying that the UK needs a bit of "shock therapy" to spur growth. Call me an old curmudgeon, but I remember when that term was used for straightening out post-Communist-overthrow Eastern European countries and Bolivia. The reshuffle bonanza in the UK comes only a few days after Lord Romney of the Commonwealth of Massachussetts accepted his party's nomination for President of the USA. Both Romney and his Vice-Presidential nominee Paul Ryan have argued for a more muscular form of austerity to reduce the deficit, while also incoherently arguing for more tax cuts.</p>

<p>There seems to be some strange disease floating across the Atlantic these days. I blame the Gulf Stream sirocco.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Wading into the fevered swamps with no boots on is always a bad idea. So today, I'll just tiptoe around the whipporwills with an extended gripe.</p>
<p>One of the arguments used by austerity defenders is that a country's finances is much like that of a household. If your family is in debt, then it is natural for you to cut your spending to pay off that debt.</p>
<p>Why? Revenue minus Costs equals Amount Paid Back. Decreasing costs increases how much you can pay off your debts.</p>
<p>Paying off your family's debt allows you to retain access to credit, which you could then use to borrow money at a later date. Fixing your family's deficit problems also means that your house, your car, and your belongings aren't repossessed.</p>
<p>Austerity defenders argue that a government is just like a home (with perhaps a few million more aunts, uncles, and cousins under your roof). When a government needs money, it seeks out money from the domestic and international bond market. When it has a large load of debt to pay off, its access to credit shrivels up. If a country, such as the USA, owes a large debt to China, that means China can come repossess Kansas at some future date.</p>
<p>Okay, fine, China can't repossess Kansas (Texas on the other hand...). But you can quickly see how the analogy could quickly become strained. Rather than needlessly explain all the key differences between a household and a government (hint: one is bigger than the other), I'll just point out where a government can do things a household cannot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governments can print money. While the member nations of the eurozone have to jump through several flaming hoops to convince Draghi to fire up the printing presses, countries such as the US and the UK can print bills at will (in reality, no printing occurs as central banks can create money through more abstract means). The fear is of course Weimarian or Hungarian style inflation, but that fear is overstated in the absence of destabilizing domestic politics. Central banks have also long fixed a 2% inflation target. Many economists have suggested raising the inflation target to 4% is enough to service debt payments while still being a galaxy away from hyperinflation. Of course, raising the inflation target means that creditors would get less real money back, and often creditors are domestic corporations and institutions with significant political influence.</li>
<li>Cutting back on government spending can severely limit growth, which in turn decreases revenue from taxes. The equivalent example would be if you decide to drastically feed your family less, resulting in a decline in your family's ability to be educated and work. You would end up with your loved ones starving in a corner all day rather than going out and bringing money into the household.</li>
<li>The consequences of long-term national unemployment could then be likened to letting your family starve while also setting fire to their car and their books, reducing their ability to be gainfully employed even if spending on food returned to previous levels.</li>
<li>Countries such as the US have political leverage with which to set the terms of debt repayments. Despite the perceived threat of bond market speculators refusing to lend more money, the US has seen nominal <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/us">bond rates</a> at their lowest levels ever. Actually, the real rates are negative, meaning that the US would make money by borrowing money. The UK also <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/uk">benefits</a> from the ability to continue borrowing at very favorable rates. Put simply, a government has far more options in dealing with its creditors than a household.</li>
</ul>
<div>Finally, as a point of comparison, both households and governments benefit from investment. In fact, both the social safety net and the idea of investing in the physical and human capital of one's country have been staples of post-war growth in the West. These have been the backbone of economic growth and creativity over the last 60 years.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you were Mitt Romney and you needed someone to invest in your future, you could just <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/romney-borrow-money-parents">ask your parents</a> for a bit of cash. Unfortunately, when most families runs out of money, the parents might have to tell Sally she can't go to college. Luckily, in countries such as the US (where the government explicitly does not behave like a household), Sally can go to subsidized public universities and take out low-interest federal loans.</div>
<p>The argument has always been that austerity to reduce the deficit is critical to putting the UK, the US, and Europe back on track. How? Well, a reduced deficit would inspire confidence in the bond market allowing these countries to once again borrow at some indeterminate point in the future to get everything back to the way it was. Not only that, it would inspire confidence among international investors and would convince them to put all that lovely foreign cash into their country of industrious recipients. The net result would be growth. And ponies for everyone. Yay.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, austerity has failed to inspire confidence or growth. Worst of all, it hasn't even reduced the deficit, the ostensible reason for enacting austerity in the first place, as a contracting economy means less and less revenue every quarter. The result in the meantime has been more and more people unemployed and deprived of the opportunity for both work and an education, perhaps permanently scarred for the rest of their life by this recession.</p>
<p>Of course, the only response from the fanatical Austerians has been "batten down the hatches" and "full steam ahead." I would be happy if they just managed to bring this ship back into port.</p>
