<p>Anyone heard from the European Union lately? Despite the fact that Euro crisis still sweeps the old continent it has been noticeably calm on the European front (maybe except the regular pay-day reminders towards Greece). No comments are heard, no plans presented. It might be the impression that all is well for the moment or the effect of summer recess, but Mr. Barroso, Mr. Van Rompuy and Mr. Draghi have gone silent for quite some time now (not to mention the permanently quiet <em>vox populi</em> of our European MPs).</p>
<p><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/331px-Giulio-cesare-enhanced_1-800x14501.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-290" title="331px-Giulio-cesare-enhanced_1-800x1450" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/331px-Giulio-cesare-enhanced_1-800x1450-e1346506007996-204x300.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>So maybe it is time to open Pandora’s Box again, before their summer sleep becomes a chronic fatigue.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Being an active European citizen trying to be involved in the politics that concerns me, I would like to ask these honoured world leaders about the direction they <em>want</em> to go with the European Union. Not where it is going, or which evolutions will influence it, but which dreams and ideals they have for Europe. Of course I am not under the illusion that my question would actually be noticed when I present it to official X of department Y under committee Z, so presenting it here will at least avoid some bureaucrat spending time writing a standard answer.</p>
<p>The reason I want to put this question out loud is because I believe Europe needs dreams if it wants to work. If there is no belief, no story, no concept to defend, the EU runs a serious risk of cracking under this (or any other) crisis.</p>
<p>The European continent has been, ever since the Nineteenth century, a victim of one of its own inventions: nationalism. It is an illusion to think this old ghost has disappeared. It still lurks in the back of European politics, only covered by a layer of political correctness. It is not the same nationalism as during the Nineteenth or Twentieth century but we shouldn’t believe its days are gone. It is merely evolving as we are redefining our collective identities.</p>
<p>There are remnants of old state-nationalism as in for example France, but far more important are the upsurges of regional nationalism (regionalism being one of those other European heritages). Scotland, Flanders, the Basque Country, Northern Italy, Bavaria,... These focal points of identity have been gathering more and more authority and autonomy through the years. Economic turmoil has the potential of reinforcing this tendency.</p>
<p>Not that this is a bad thing <em>per se</em> but the European Union runs the risk of being caught out. With the nation-states on guard and the regions as gathering points for the disgruntled, the EU needs to realise that it cannot survive by building on its passive political strategies of the past, relying on the quiet endorsement of the national governments.</p>
<p>The European continent currently resembles a Roman triumvirate: every institutional level has its function and builds on its respective strengths. Caesar had popularity, Pompey Magnus respectability, and Crassus money. A similar division of labour exists between the regional, national and European governments.</p>
<p>But just as in 60 B.C., the members of the triumvirate are also fierce competitors amongst themselves. Every time the crisis worseness, this competition will increase as well. In the end, just as with the Roman Empire, a new equilibrium will need to be found. And we know very well who tipped the balance in Rome and which of the mentioned three qualities he used.</p>
<p>So I therefore repeat my question towards our European representatives: how will you fight the battle for popularity? Tell me why I, just as many other undecided nationalists, should place my faith in you and identify with a European future. If you can’t come up with a convincing answer in the next months and years, I fear you might become the Crassus of the triumvirate: increasingly irrelevant and not missed when finally gone.</p>
