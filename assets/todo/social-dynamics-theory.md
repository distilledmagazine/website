<p dir="ltr">For hundreds of years, scientists and engineers relied on Newtonian mechanics to describe the physical world around them. Newtonian mechanics was a great success. It described nearly everything one sees on a daily basis, from artillery trajectories to why and how earth revolves around the sun.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the addition of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Electromagnetism.html">electromagnetism</a> in the 19th century, physics was complete. Everything was described, all we had left to do was the math and paperwork. Science was over.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then, people started to discover that there were some things that were very difficult to explain. The <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/orbit-of-mercury">orbit of Mercury</a> around the sun was longer than predicted, and light continued to curiously behave at once like a stream of particles and a wave. Specifically, as systems got bigger or smaller, existing physical models more often failed to explain and predict the measured phenomena.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Physics was sick. Scientists from around the world struggled to keep up with the increasing slate of unexplainable phenomena by developing ever more baroque and ornate modifications to their existing theories. For many scientists, and the general public, it soon became impossible to keep up with the various models and sub-models, equations and formulas that described increasingly more exotic occurrences.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then things started changing. Physicists like <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Niels_Bohr">Neils Bohr</a> and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Hendrik_Lorentz">Hendrik Lorentz</a> began toying with the idea of conceptually reframing or finding alternatives to current models. These eminent minds were given freedom to explore increasingly unorthodox ideas while the rest of the scientific community lagged behind.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, in 1905, Albert <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Annus_Mirabilis_papers">Einstein published two papers</a> that established two new fields totally distinct from Newtonian mechanics and electromagnetism. In quantum mechanics and special relativity, physics could suddenly explain the breakdown moving inward to the microscopic and outward to gigantic size and speed. <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Quantum_mechanics">Quantum mechanics</a> is the study of phenomena that are very small, the dynamics of molecules, atoms, and the building blocks that make them. In the quantum world, the act of observation is relatively large compared to the phenomena being observed, meaning that the act of observation changes what is being observed. Dynamics become unpredictable and Newtonian mechanics breaks down.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Theory_of_relativity">Relativity</a> is the study of phenomena that are very large, the dynamics of stars, galaxies, and black holes. In the realm described by relativity, systems are massive and complex, distorting the space and time around them. Dynamics again become unpredictable and Newtonian mechanic breaks down.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Einstein started a revolution that was soon carried on by others, such as <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Arthur_Eddington">Eddington</a>, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Werner_Heisenberg">Heisenberg</a>, and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger">Schrödinger</a>. Collectively, they reframed problems of the very big and very small to make explicit that Newtonian mechanics had limitations. Soon, all the complicated formulas and suppositions that made up the ornate corrections of Newtonian mechanics were related with simple, elegant descriptions of what could and could not be known in these realms. While Newtonian mechanics was an approximation of both relativity and quantum mechanics, physicists suddenly realized that there were certain areas where completely new theories and ways of thinking were required to not only describe problems but also find solutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Neoclassical economics is the Newtonian mechanics of social science. With approximate assumptions that simplify out any complex interactions, neoclassical economics allows us to make predictions about systems within a certain range of sizes that are confined to a certain space over a certain period of time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This economics, however, fails when it attempts to describe an individual or small group relations. People are not <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rational_choice_theory">rational</a>, do not have fixed immutable preferences over time, and do not enjoy perfect information; homo economicus is a mythical creature. Humans are inherently complex, irrational machines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Neoclassical economics likewise fails when it attempts to describe large groups, like national and international economies, or the global financial services sector. At this scale. the size of systems and the inherent chaos within them renders prediction beyond the reach of such simplified assumptions. Simply assuming that we can mindlessly sum immutable preferences without complex interaction or large bubbles is as absurd on its face as it is in practice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, many of our problems originate in systems where economics fails to capture their inherent complexity. Problems that result from large scale human systems include <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/bipartisan-climate-change/">climate change</a>, large financial recessions, and the instability of the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/robbing-futures-illicit-financial-flows-in-the-global-economy/">global supply chain network</a>. For these problems, economics currently cannot fully describe and predict the behavior of their underlying systems, and its current methodologies never will.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Economics, and the broader landscape of social dynamics must follow physics path to abandon its simple assumptions at the very small and the very large. It must explore the inner and outer realms of our understanding. It cannot claim ignorance time and again as unpredicted major <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Japanese_asset_price_bubble" target="_blank">crashes</a> follow <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1997_Asian_financial_crisis" target="_blank">one</a> after <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308" target="_blank">another</a> without some introspection.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">We at <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/">Distilled</a> Magazine are interested in starting a search for what can explain these new worlds of complexity and unpredictability that lie outside the realm of mere data and models. We welcome a wide variety of proposals and analyses from across the ideological spectrum from all around the world. We hope to better illuminate these new realms of understanding and together produce a better, clearer vision for the future.</p>
