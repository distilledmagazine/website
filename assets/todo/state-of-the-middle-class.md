<p style="text-align: justify;">My parents, with their two children, in many ways typified what's considered to be the "American dream". Though neither of them went to college, they worked hard and saved up to make sure that both my sister and I could.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A middle class life like that of my family is something that is aspired to throughout the world. This ideal being that anyone, regardless of economic or social background, can be able to get a good education, work hard to lead a relatively secure life, and retire with dignity. These principle values of what it means to be a middle class American, however, have become warped and twisted. Now, we are left with something that barely resembles the ideal forged, and subsequently upheld, by New Deal era Americans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are several key flaws with the American middle class as it exists today. In a way, the lifestyle has become an unsustainable commodity rather than an idea. Corporations like Coca Cola and Walt Disney have been able to convert something that people around the world once upheld as a set of values and way of life into an association with specific products like soda and Minnie Mouse.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Now instead of being about working hard and having a fair shot at an education and a good job, the ideal has become about consuming products and making money to consume those products. The dangerous thing is that people throughout the world now emotionally associate this with good values. But there is really no pride to be had in rabid consumerism and material wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My purpose here though is not to chide those who are striving to obtain a semblance of monetary wealth. But this economy all too often succeeds by sacrificing those that are trying hardest to "make it". I long to express these sentiments because as a society, and as a people, we cannot flourish until we shed the bonds of corporate slavery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even my family has been largely left behind by the corporate machine. Although my parents were able to help my sister and I attend college, due to the Great Recession and other economic woes, they have almost no retirement savings. With an increasing number of Americans uninsured, on food stamps, or unable to retire with dignity, the American dream is slipping away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We must as a society work together to remedy this, not only for America, but for the global community as a whole. First we must strive to reclaim what it means to fulfill the “American Dream”. Shift away from a consumer centric ideal to one that is focused on ethics, hard work, and collective action. Secondly we must ensure that we lift up our fellow man, inch-by-inch, in the image of the new American dream that we craft together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Only after we accomplish those two arduous but imperative responsibilities will we be able to truly create a global community that reflects the spirit of the American dream. One in which a person is able to, by their own merit, achieve great things. Until then, we will unfortunately continue to perpetuate a false, hollow dream.</p>
