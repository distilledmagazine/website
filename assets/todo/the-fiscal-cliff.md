<p style="text-align: justify;">The top two percent of American taxpayers are only worried about the "fiscal cliff" because they rightly fear that Republican lawmakers will eventually have to allow a bill to pass restoring the Bush tax cuts for just those earning under $250,000. Most Americans shouldn't fear, however, because as CBS explains:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"If the nation goes over the cliff - but then lawmakers work out a deal in, say, late January - it will not be nearly as bad as all that suggests. It's true that many of us would see slightly more money coming out of our paychecks at the start of the year, but lawmakers could retroactively reverse the tax hike once they work out a deal. (You'd then effectively get a bonus in your next paycheck.) Since both parties agree that the Bush-era tax cuts should be extended for the vast majority of Americans, it's unlikely that most of us would end up taking a serious hit over the long run."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To be clear, by "Republican lawmakers" I mean the 20-30 that Speaker Boehner corrals together to vote with him and the Democrats to reach a deal. This handful of hypothetical GOP congressmen campaigned on not raising anyone's taxes this past year, however they'll be able to argue in their next election that they actually were voting to lower taxes (for nearly everyone) when they restored the Bush tax cuts.</p>
