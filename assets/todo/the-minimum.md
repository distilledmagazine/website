<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/imagine-all-the-people-all-the-things.png" target="_blank">Imagine</a> a world without a single trace of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/watch?v=dABGVnHWuyc" target="_blank">Lenin</a>, without a single leftover from Bolshevism. Does that sound inconceivable? Not if you approach it from a musical perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/484" target="_blank">Yesterday</a> the London Symphonic Orchestra embarked on a similar experiment at their home ground, the Barbican Centre in London. Holding the baton was John Adams, the American minimalist composer.  The main dish of the evening was <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/0XelnTSOhmjkG9YDi9nr1Z" target="_blank"><em>Harmonielehre</em></a>, a 1985 piece by... John Adams, the American minimalist composer. This is our starting point to imagine a world without a trace of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/watch?v=dABGVnHWuyc" target="_blank">Lenin</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <em>Harmonielehre </em>"Adams imagines a history of 20th century music", so the programme notes tell us, but one "in which Arnold Schoenberg never existed". To some, that might sound the same as envisioning a history of 20th century physics without Einstein, or of psychology without Freud. But those comparisons are flawed. Art isn't science.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No, imagining last century's music history without Schoenberg is far more similar to telling the story of its political theory without <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/watch?v=dABGVnHWuyc" target="_blank">Lenin</a>. Again from the programme notes: "His ideas have continued to resonate, as much as some of us have tried to wish him away." And yet, Adams somehow pulled it off.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/0aITIYNh7FRdclvQdyz7DK" target="_blank">Arnold Schoenberg's work</a> was the apex of Modernist music, a genre that can be dated back to 10 June 1865 with the first performance of Wagner's <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2tRzeYpyE3IpekgOYUbzPG" target="_blank"><em>Tristan und Isolde</em></a>. This opera was the first to make dramatic use of dissonance and atonality, an approach taken to the extreme by Schoenberg. The life cycle of Communism looks surprisingly similar. In the 1867 first edition of <em>Das Kapital</em>, Karl Marx was the first to combine the notion of class struggle with a structural analysis of capitalism, an approach taken to the extreme by <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/watch?v=dABGVnHWuyc" target="_blank">Lenin</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adams' recipe to "edit out" Schoenberg from his music is surprisingly simple. Just start from the classical canon of the early 20th century and apply the lessons of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Minimalism" target="_blank">Minimalism</a>. This means continuous, repetitive structures combined with Romantic harmony and expression. Have a taste of the result in the video above, or listen to the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/0XelnTSOhmjkG9YDi9nr1Z" target="_blank">entire work</a> while we work out what this means for contemporary politics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first time the word "Minimalism" was used in the English language, was in reference to the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Menshevik" target="_blank">Russian Menshevik Party</a>.  Coincidentally those Mensheviks, a part of the broader Social-Democratic movement, were also the biggest rivals of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/watch?v=dABGVnHWuyc" target="_blank">Lenin</a>'s Bolsheviks <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Russian_Revolution#Between_February_and_throughout_October:_.22Dual_Power.22_.28dvoevlastie.29" target="_blank">after the Russian Revolution</a> of February 1917.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Bolsheviks were right to see <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Social_democracy" target="_blank">Social Democracy</a> as its biggest enemy. Ignoring the utopian fantasies of Communism, Social Democrats went for tangible results. In Russia the Mensheviks <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Menshevik#After_the_1917_Revolution" target="_blank">never got the chance</a>, but elsewhere this strategy worked just like that of John Adams. Adding universal suffrage and social security — repetition and continuity? — to the strengths of early 20th century capitalism has created harmony and innovation across the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take note America, where every serious debate ends with <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/vp-debate-attendee-tells-chris-matthews-obama-is-a-communist-but-cant-explain-what-a-communist-is" target="_blank">people wrongly calling each other communists</a>. Some  <em>Harmonielehre</em> would work wonders. A combination of the business-friendly <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Progressive_era" target="_blank">Progressive Era</a> with a touch of European Social Democracy could finally pull the U.S. out of this post-Cold War deadlock. Only then will America have truly defeated Communism, at last expelling the ghost of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/watch?v=dABGVnHWuyc" target="_blank">Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov</a>.</p>
