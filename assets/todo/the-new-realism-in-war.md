<p>In his most recent <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/20128812583352206.html">blog</a> on the Al Jazeera website, Professor Tarak Barkawi of the New School for Social Research was very critical of the human rights organisations commenting on the Syrian crisis.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1235" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/iraq.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1235" title="iraq" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/iraq-300x221.jpg" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/soldiersmediacenter/2068920112/sizes/z/in/photostream/" width="300" height="221" /></a> http://www.flickr.com/photos/soldiersmediacenter/2068920112/sizes/z/in/photostream/[/caption]</p>
<p>According to Professor Barkawi, groups such as Human Rights Watch ignore the realities of war by trying to be impartial. Their legal discourse only serves to avoid the difficult choices that need to be made: “Perhaps it is time for human rights organisations to dispense with the lawyers and start studying politics and the paradoxes of war”.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Moreover, these groups (as well as the UN) are trapped in the laws of war as they have been put down by states. But these laws are unclear and don’t apply to this type of conflict: “Ban Ki-moon's comment also implies there will be some grand trial where good and bad, right and wrong, legal and illegal all will be decided. In the real world, we know that the powerful write the laws and the victors hold the trials”.</p>
<p>When read at first, Barkawi’s article seems overly critical. What is wrong with being impartial? What could be wrong about holding a trial to judge everyone in relation to their behaviour in war?</p>
<p>But there are deeper issues to which this criticism relates.</p>
<p>Firstly, this legalism demonstrates the lack of direct experience most of the Western world has with the phenomenon of combat.</p>
<p>Of course, the United States and most European countries have been involved in the battlefields of Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. But these were, despite the rhetoric, offensive wars aimed at exporting our cultural and political system. Moreover, these wars were fought abroad by our professional armies, with which an increasing part of the population no longer has a direct connection (more so in Europe than the US).</p>
<p>When was the last time <em>we</em> had to fight dirty to save what we hold dear? Or sacrifice everything in order to survive? When was the last time we had to defend our values with a knife at our throats?</p>
<p>Not that it is a bad thing that we have avoided such wars, but this results in people commenting on conflict as if it is governed by simple laws: soldiers might die, civilians need to live. Barkawi is absolutely right to criticize this attitude.</p>
<p>Secondly, the comments from human rights organisations are symptomatic of a growing tension we feel about the principles we hold dear.</p>
<p>No one will doubt that it is a good thing that civilians are kept out of harm’s way, but has this goal primacy above all else? We are keen on defending our values, but which are the most important ones? Right to life? Democracy? Freedom of Religion? A right not to live in poverty? Especially in war this question becomes crucial.</p>
<p>The last two decades provide clear examples of this tension. In Somalia, we had to decide between aiding the local people and keeping our troops safe. In Afghanistan we got caught between winning a war and (re)building a country. By the time the dust cleared in Iraq, the coalition wasn’t even sure anymore why it was there. The Libyan intervention now seems a success, but was at first controversial because the outcome was (and is) unsure. And in relation to the Syrian case, Barkawi correctly states that we have to decide whether we want the rebels to fight fairly or to defeat the dictator.</p>
<p>In war, we can’t have everything we want.</p>
<p>So despite the scorn he might receive, Barkawi’s text actually presents us a much needed mirror. We carefully need to consider that war is, more than we realize, a world on its own, where normal answers do not apply. And maybe even more important, we need to start thinking about which of our values we want to apply and how to apply them.</p>
<p>The powerful do write the laws and the victors do hold the trials, but they still can make conscious choices about them. Within a changing world, it is time to make sure they do so.</p>
