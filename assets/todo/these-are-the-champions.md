<p>I'm starting to write this post simultaneous with this season's Champions League kick-off, and coincidentally, that is also what I'll be writing about. For the American readers, I'm talking about football. <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/i.php?n=3849">Foot. Ball.</a></p>
<p>Today I'll be following the Real Champions of Europe. No, that does not mean I'm tuning in to Real Madrid against Manchester City. If I wanted to see obscene amounts of money being thrown around at random, I'd watch the EuroMillions draw.</p>
<p>No, tonight I'm watching Montpellier-Arsenal. (As I'm typing this Montpellier scores the 1-0 on penalty.) Why? Personal preference plays its part, as people who follow my social media exploits will know. But I won't bore you with that stuff here. (GOOOOOOAAALLL!  1-1 ARSENAL!!! — Okay, I gave myself away there...) In this blog I want to talk about Montpellier. (Another one! 1-2 Arsenal!) Because they are the real champions I was referring to — even though they're losing at the moment. (For the sake of the article, I'll stop referring to the game now.)</p>

<p>Economically, Montpellier are the real Champions of Europe. Budget-wise, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/18156868">they did a David on France's Goliath last year</a>, beating PSG to win the French league. The full operating costs of Montpellier HSC during their title-winning season were around 35 million euros. PSG spent three times that amount on incoming transfers alone, not counting wages or other costs. If the baseball model of <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Moneyball">Moneyball</a> is applicable to football, it should be called Montpelleyball.</p>
<p>But it isn't. In fact, the story of Montpellier is just a rare fairy tale in a far grimmer book. One of the big men behind Moneyball in baseball, Boston Red Sox owner John W Henry, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/liverpool-moneyball-nesv" target="_blank">tried to do something similar at Liverpool</a>, and <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/john-w-henry-fsg-liverpool" target="_blank">failed</a>. In the United States, sports teams are profitable enterprises, making <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/investing-in-sports-teams-and-groups.aspx" target="_blank">good value on the stock markets</a>. In football, even the most profitable club in the world, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/manchester-united%E2%80%99s-ipo" target="_blank">Manchester United, is an economic failure</a>. Or, as <em>The Economist</em> put it, in football <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/manchester-uniteds-ipo" target="_blank">debt beats equity</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than those of business, European football follows the rules of art.  John Cleese put it most eloquently: <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/watch?v=2sD_8prYOxo" target="_blank">"Whereas American Football is played like a series of advertising jingles, soccer is played like jazz."</a> And that's why it deserves to be in the <a href="http://www.distilledmagazine.com/blog/?cat=10" target="_blank">Arts &amp; Science Section</a> of Distilled Daily.</p>
