<p dir="ltr">Last week, Detroit, Michigan became the fourth major city in five weeks in which fast food workers organized work stoppages in protest of low wages, variable schedules, and tenuous employment. These protesting workers included employees of major chains such as McDonald's, Wendy’s, and Long John Silvers. The rising tide of strikes began in New York City, and have since flooded to Chicago, St. Louis, and now Detroit. The latest strike in Detroit involved over 400 workers across multiple chains, even leading to the shut down of restaurants across the city -- making it the largest fast food worker stoppage in US history.</p>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">This is huge. These strikers are non-union workers, which means that they are walking off the job with almost no protections. Service industry jobs, such as those in the fast food sector, are <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/fast-food-workers-strike-st-louis#">a growing percentage</a> of the American workforce. Yet, employers at these chains continue to offer jobs that are typically underpaid and have little opportunity for advancement.</p>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">Mega-corporations, however, are not the only villains in this tale of exploitation. There are many steps that the US, and other governments, could take to provide protections to workers. Higher minimum wages, the right to bargain, and other measures could help ensure that workers are able to function and prosper in their place of employment. It is shameful that governments cannot afford basic protections to those that are providing the very services that fuel much of the economy.</p>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">The unwillingness of governments and corporations to create structures in which workers can eke out a dignified existence has led to increasing levels of discontent among US and global workers.</p>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">The global manifestation of this unrest is exemplified by the the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/us-bangladesh-building-idUSBRE94C0BL20130513">garment worker tragedy in Bangladesh</a>. This disaster has sparked a global public dialogue about the working class. While the empirical conditions of the working class in America and Bangladesh may be quite different, there are more commonalities than we might realize. Workers throughout the world have universal basic rights to dignity, safety, and security on the job. Whether in the factories of Bangladesh, or the kitchens of McDonald’s, these needs are not being met.</p>

<p dir="ltr">There is an opportunity for the unification of a powerful, global working class. The increased globalization of our economy has hurt many blue collar workers. Globalization has taken jobs and uprooted them, draining capital away from wages and into the pockets of CEO’s and offshore tax havens.</p>
<p><b><b> </b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">There are opportunities though for this globalized culture to be used to our advantage. We are increasingly interconnected via technology and social media -- potent tools for global organization. A unified front against the iniquities of industrial exploitation, facilitated by the ability to create global communities through social media would be something unlike anything the world has ever seen. These workers, in the US and across the world, are courageous. Their actions deserve the support of allies across the globe. The working class of this world has been exploited enough. Let’s hope that through the ability to connect globally, we can work together to foster a global community that works together for justice and human dignity in the work place.</p>
