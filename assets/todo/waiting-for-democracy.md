<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">On 6 February, the Tunisian leftist-secular opposition leader Chokri Belaid was shot and killed. His death set off a wave of protest and violence, much of it directed at the Islamist-led authorities. Protestors torched and ransacked offices of the ruling Ennahda party and many workers initiated a general strike. In response the government announced it would hand power to a caretaker administration composed of technocrats until fresh elections were held.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In other parts of the Arab world as well revolutionary jubilation has given way to bitter disputes and violence. In Egypt, President Morsi’s attempts to push through a controversial constitution by way of national referendum set off a firestorm pitting liberals against Islamists in often violent confrontation. Meanwhile in Libya militias not under the control of the government continue to operate. Security in the country is woefully inadequate. The Benghazi attacks were a tragic example, with an Al Qaeda group burning down the US Consulate, killing the ambassador in the process.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Many Western commentators are now warning that the optimistic sounding "Arab Spring" is has given way to a cold "Islamic Winter".</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Critics now lament the West’s decision to help oust the various Arab dictators at whom the popular uprisings were directed because their removal has resulted in widespread uncertainty and instability. Worse still, are the various claims that the Arab world is somehow "not ready" for democracy or that Middle Eastern culture is fundamentally "undemocratic".</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In reality though, healthy democratic communities do not just "kick in" overnight (see video). On the contrary, they often take years if not decades to mature and this process is usually fraught with violence. And if anyone should know this, it is the countries of the West because their democratic development was itself rarely quick or peaceful. There is perhaps no better example than the cradle of modern European democracy itself, France.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">While modern France is a healthy democracy, the road to achieving this was long and arduous. The French Revolution in 1789 was meant to bring political power and civil rights to the people, but quickly gave way to Jacobean terror, Napoleonic Empire, and eventually a restoration of the Monarchy. It was not until the 1870s that a stable democratic society was formed in the Third Republic – over 80 years on from the original revolution.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Other Western countries have followed similar paths. Between 1873 and 1975, Spain went through a series of republics, monarchies and dictatorship.  In 1918, the newly independent countries of Central Europe started off as democratic nations before being taken over by fascist dictators, and later by Soviet-backed communists, only to return to democracy after the Cold War. The relative stability in the histories of the UK and the US is the exception that proves the rule.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Legitimate democratic institutions take time to develop. Claiming that there is something inherently undemocratic in the Middle East, just because they couldn't accomplish in a year or two what took decades in the West itself, is nothing short of hypocrisy.</p>
