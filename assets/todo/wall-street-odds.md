<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">        Wall Street did not fail because of subprime mortgages.  It did not fail because its bets were too risky.  It failed because its bets all failed at the same time.  Its bets were not independent.  There is a very big difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Even, or perhaps especially, amongst Wall Street’s strongest critics, there is a misconception that Wall Street crashed because they were betting on assets that were too risky.  The litany of press following the crisis often focused on the ridiculous credit that was offered to home-buyers without any showing of ability to pay.  Sub-prime mortgages, including the so-called NINJA loans (No Income, No Job, and no Assets), described mortgages that required <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ninja-loan.asp" target="_blank">virtually no proof of income</a>.  Their absurdity is obvious on its face.  Anyone can immediately see that it is a risky idea to lend money to a borrower who has shown no ability to repay.  When these loans failed in large numbers after the crisis, it looked like a classic example of foolish gambling that cost us all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, it really is not that simple.  An individual loan necessarily fails more often when the borrower is more risky.  Diversified risky mortgages do not necessary fail more often.  Take a simple example of betting on a coin flip.  If you bet all your money on either heads or tails, it is a risky bet that will fail 50% of the time.  However, if you bet half your money on heads and half on tails, it is a riskless bet that will fail 0% of the time.  Each bet individually was risky, both carried a 50% chance of failure, but together, they were riskless.  Diversification takes out all of the risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">It does not follow that risky mortgages are more likely to fail together.  Tell all the stories you want about mortgages that were given to people who did not deserve them.  It does not matter, and it does not get us closer to showing the cause of the crisis.  If they had been properly diversified, it would not have mattered that mortgages were risky.  “Put a sufficient number of subprime mortgages together from different parts of the country and from different originators … and it is indeed possible to convert a substantial quantity of the subprime frogs into AAA-rated princes, provided that the correlation between mortgage defaults is low.”  (<a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/0691152632" target="_blank">Raghuram Rajan, p. 134</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The correlation between mortgage defaults was not low.  This is the key.  Properly diversified risks must either be independent or negatively related.  In the case of the coin, the probabilities were perfectly negatively related, meaning that heads happened when tails did not and vice versa.  This led to perfectly diversified risk.  If risks are independent, meaning that one event does not influence the odds of another, then diversification will reduce the risk imperfectly but predictably.  Simply multiplying the chances of each happening individually gives the chances of both happening at once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">If mortgages are independent, then there should be no major declines in the national real estate market.  On the other hand, if there were a national real estate decline based on one individual cause, then these mortgages would not be independent and would fail at the same time.  Diversification would not apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">What are the odds of a national real estate decline?  Risk analysts went to big data to solve this problem and found that a major national real estate decline had never happened in the modern U.S. housing market, seen before 2007 in the graph below.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Not only was it unusual, it had never happened.  A working assumption of independence seems justified.  With that assumption come risk calculations such as Black-Scholes and Market Portfolio Theory that take independence to its most extreme logical conclusions.  Wall Street could value its risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">        Unfortunately, as I argued for the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/catching-four-foul-balls/" target="_blank">odds of catching four foul balls</a>, assumptions must always be reevaluated with new information.  Mortgage-backed securities put many mortgages from all over the country together into one security.  If a mortgage-backed security fails, the failure itself is evidence that the real estate market is not independent.  Failure of one is evidence that we cannot calculate failure of multiple mortgage-backed securities as if they were independent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Here is an example of what I mean.  Say you have 100 coins in a bag.  99 are normal, fair coins, but one of them is unfair and has two heads.  We are trying to calculate the chances of flipping 20 heads in a row.  Because the probability of grabbing a fair coin is so high, we could operate under the assumption that it is fair.  We would find that there is below a 1/1,000,000 chance that a fair coin will come up 20 heads in a row.  This would be horribly misleading and would lead us to discount a possibility that is orders of magnitude more likely.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">If we select a coin at random from the bag and calculate the probability that there will be 20 heads in a row, we should update our assumption of a fair coin with each new flip result.  To do this, we will use <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Bayes%27_rule" target="_blank">Bayes’ Rule</a>, in the form of P(Fair coin given # Heads) = (P(# Heads given Fair)*P(Fair)) / (P(# Heads given Fair)*P(Fair) + P(# Heads given Unfair)*P(Unfair)).</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">If the randomly-selected coin comes up 10 heads in a row, there is a 91% chance that our assumption was wrong.  Notice that we started with a very low probability that the coin was unfair, only 1%, but after a string of 10 heads, the new information prohibitively favored our assumption was wrong.  If our assumption is wrong, then that the coin will keep coming up heads ad infinitum and any calculation on the basis of independence will be grossly misleading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Applying this idea to securities markets, the 20 assumption of a fair coin is the assumption that the national real estate cannot fall simultaneously.  Seeing 20 heads in a row represents some a catastrophic failure of the mortgage market of the type that we saw in 2007-2008.  Once a certain number of failures started happening all over the country, it became ever increasingly likely that the assumption was wrong and failures would continue.  Every failure makes it more and more likely that we were in the situation that we assumed was impossible and that it would continue to get worse ad infinitum until there was bankruptcy or government intervention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">If any dependence is allowed, even as a small possibility, then calculations of joint probabilities based on independence will be horribly misleading.  We discovered that there were interrelated and dependent probabilities in the housing market.  It was a bad idea to bundle mortgages from around the country as if they were independent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">However, if we want to prevent this type of catastrophe in the future, the conclusion must not be so limited.  Assuming independence is a dangerous and liable to extreme failure.  As this example shows, odds can run away very quickly if some dependence is allowed.  If we allow finance to build up risks and leverage equity on the basis of independence without any form of Bayesian updating of their assumptions, the next crisis is inevitable.  Rating agencies did not fail to appreciate the risk because the underlying assets were more risky; they failed to appreciate the value of checking assumptions against new information.</p>
