<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Modernity has two faces: a serious face and an ironical one, but really it has only just one.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We, young people embody this face with much more passion than medievals embodied their religious icons. When we do this - with the brands we display, the continuous collage of self-consciousness that is our garderobe and the endless gestures of jokes that inform our moral attitude - we also constantly question it, that is the most indispensible part, the essence.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Oh yes, we know very well that the ironic is more than just a stylistic figure, manifested in sheer infinite “buts,” “yets” and “howevers”. That it in fact served as a metaphysical template for the 20th century, its beauties, its dark sides, its laughs and cries. But where does it originally come from?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The first to build a world founded on the impossibility of building was Franz Kafka, a master in the immediately taking back of every statement just made, only to take it up again with a barely perceptible shift, often to retract it yet again within the same sentence. “We can hold back from the suffering of the world,” he said. In fact, we are free to do so and it is even “in accord with our nature,” but “precisely this holding back is the only suffering that you might be able to avoid.”</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/we-are-irony/kafka/" rel="attachment wp-att-2143"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2143" alt="kafka" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/kafka.jpg" width="276" height="166" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Avoid? Almost a century later, Kafka’s tactics of infinitely receding has become a habit shared by a whole society. For us, born in the 1980s and 1990s, members of Generation Y — the E-generation or I-generation — Kafka’s irony is something we daily accept. Take for example this quote from Blackadder: “I want to be remembered when I'm dead. And hundreds of years from now, I want episodes from my life played out weekly at half past nine by some great actor of the age.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">It is a self-unmasking tactics, unmasking the narrative – the backbone of all art, religion and culture – as just a construction. By acknowledging the failure to accomplish anything lasting meaningful, all attacks are pre-emptively pushed back. The ironic cannot be conquered, as it has conquered itself. It is the same thing we encounter in countless numbers of movies, soaps and novels. It is the humour of the immediate self-contradiction, and everyday we passionately inflict it upon our peers and ourselves.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Of course, both progressives and conservatives criticize this. They complain that the militancy of postmodernism has been replaced by relativism, or alternatively that the endless self-undermining has led to a loss of such things like the ‘art of conversation’, or the ‘art of looking at people’, the art of ‘being seen’, the art of ‘being there’, etc… As ageing critics have always done and will always continue to do, they observe that the younger generation is sadly lacking subtlety, finesse, grace or attention. They cry out for an alternative to our terrible ‘inwardness’ and ‘narcissism.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Narcissism! As if we do all this for ourselves! Do these people really think we enjoy it that much? All this insistent <em>spielerei</em> all the time, all that liking and unliking! Every time again collecting new clothes, new brands, expressing ourselves in new and endlessly changing ways. Every time again holding back from being in the world, from making any lasting statement or presence!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We wouldn’t do all that if we didn’t believe in it! If we didn’t happen to think that this is our way — in all its irony — of being in the world, that our language speaks what needs to be spoken, that our jokes make fun of what is laughable, and that our attitude embodies our true essence, then why should we want to avoid it? It is what we are, suffering or not. Try and stop us, try and mock us: we <em>are</em> Irony!</p>
