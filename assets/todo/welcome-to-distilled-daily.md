<p>Today, it's Standard Chartered <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/standard-chartered-chief-defends-bank">denying any wrong-doing</a> under allegations from the New York Department for Financial Services that the "good" bank knowingly conducted transactions involving American dollars with Iran — currently under heavy sanctions from the USA.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23" title="640px-Standard_Chartered_Bank_China_in_Guangzhou_Tianhe" alt="" src="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/640px-Standard_Chartered_Bank_China_in_Guangzhou_Tianhe.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></p>

<p>Wait, that sounds familiar? Oh right, last week it was HSBC <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/hsbc-executive-resigns-senate">admitting to laundering billions</a> for Mexican drug cartels and terrorist organizations.</p>
<p>But surely, these are just a few bad apples in an otherwise fruitful orchard? Except, before HSBC and Standard Chartered, we had <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/business-18671255">Barclay's knowingly manipulating the London Inter Bank Offered Rate</a>, the outward manifestation — if there ever was one — of mutual trust among the financial institutions that underpin modern capitalism. To what purpose? For bonuses, of course.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mervyn King, the central banker for the Bank of England, <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-growth-forecasts">cuts the growth forecast</a> of the UK to zero as it must become increasingly clear to King, Cameron, and Osborne that no amount of quantitative easing and "confidence building" on the bond market will save Britain from being the victim of its own austerity policies.</p>
<p>Or even worse, the victim of its own financial services sector.</p>
<p>If we just focus our story to this side of the Atlantic, it seems that the basic underpinnings of a robust capitalism, built on trust, capitalism, common values, and even some sense of collective social responsibility, are rapidly falling prey to either greed or even more ominously, the morality of  mechanistic, numerically-driven organizational incentive structures. But the story isn't just limited to this side of the Atlantic, or even the Western world.</p>

<p>As I pointed out in the <a title="Letter from the Editor-in-chief" href="http://distilledmagazine.com/letter-from-the-editor-in-chief/">introductory letter</a> to <strong><em>Distilled</em></strong>, current affairs remains the lord of all stories. The relations between people and events becomes ever more convoluted, and backstories ever deeper and darker.</p>
<p>At this very moment, the future of who leads the United States of America (the world's biggest army and national economy) is being decided by millions of so-called <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/dumb_and_dumber">"low information voters"</a>.</p>
<p>Putin's attempt to perfect a "managed democracy" suffers <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/pussy-riot-trial-closing-statement">a setback</a> from art-rock-punk collective Pussy Riot, a group with seemingly more influence to highlight the state of modern Russia than many NGOs and human rights organizations.</p>
<p>The bizarre story of the rise and fall of Chongqing politician Bo Xilai and the alleged poisoning of British businessman Neil Heywood continues today with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/10/world/asia/murder-trial-of-bo-xilais-wife-concludes.html?ref=world">the conclusion of the trial</a> of Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, who according to officials all but admitted to the poisoning.</p>
<p>A new assault on the human rights record of Europe's last dictatorship has been launched by <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/belarus_teddy_bear_fury_continues">teddy bears dropped</a> over Belarus by Swedish activists.</p>
<p><a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wisconsin-usa">Yet another shooting</a>, this time a racially motivated act of terrorism at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, provokes many Americans to reconsider the still vibrant culture of racism, hate, and violent extremism within their own communities.</p>
<p>The long march toward <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/democracy-and-the-arab-uprisings/">democratic legitimacy</a> in the Arab world <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/cruel_summer">staggers onward</a> in Libya and Tunisia despite setbacks in<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/09/world/middleeast/egypt-sinai-attacks.html?ref=world"> Egypt</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/10/world/middleeast/offensive-in-aleppo-syria-enters-second-day.html?ref=world">Syria</a>. Two of the region's longtime adversaries, Israel and Iran, continue<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/09/world/middleeast/murky-plots-and-attacks-tied-to-shadow-war-of-iran-and-israel.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world"> to pursue a covert war</a> as the issue of nuclear armament looms large over the international community.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the world watches the microcosm of drama in every leap and dive at the <a href="http://distilledmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/london-2012-olympics-day-13-live-blog">Olympics in London</a>.</p>
<p>What is the big story that motivates all these remarkable events and changes taking place in the world today? What are the overlying narrative threads?</p>
