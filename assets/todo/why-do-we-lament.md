<p style="text-align: justify;">Why do we lament? And when we do, what does it mean? There are two distinct ways to approach this: one from the perspective of the philosopher, and one from the perspective of the person who actually suffers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The philosopher Gershom Scholem wrote in 1917 that lament is the <em>language of the border</em>, of the transition between what can be said and what remains mute. Language is infinite in its failure to express the absolute. To make sense of this, Scholem (via his friend Walter Benjamin) let the idea of the <em>Fall from Paradise</em> inspire him. The idea that we are no longer in a state of silent grace, where all things still have their proper names. We lost that state when we entered the real world. Lament is simply the moment where that “fallenness” is most clearly visible. Laments are accusations of this state of “fallenness”, accusations impossibilities of language.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A pretty grim outlook for someone who was only 20 years old at the time. Had the young Scholem really suffered that much already? In his diaries we find the emotional life of your average twenty-something: first loves, but no reciprocated interests from girls; feeling misunderstood by friends and parents… So these ideas couldn't stem purely from his own life. They came out of the Hebrew Bible.</p>

<div dir="ltr"><em>How deserted lies the city,</em></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 5px;"><em>once so full of people!</em></div>
<div dir="ltr"><em>How like a widow is she,</em></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 5px;"><em>who once was great among the nations!</em></div>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 20px;">(Lamentations 1:1)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Is it possible for us to read the book of Lamentations, or the book of Job, just like the young Scholem did? To think about them the way he did? Can you watch people lamenting, like a mother over her deceased child, and say that she is only accusing language? No one who actually has a right to lament tries to understand it philosophically. To them, language is not the issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"How deserted lies the city?" These words are no request for information to which there can be an answer. Readers know they're mourning the Babylonian destruction of Jeruzalem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--column--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lament only needs disaster. It might invite, but does not require words of consolation. As the Jewish thinker Moshe Halbertal says, it is "a bewildered protest, in which a disaster is experienced as trauma". There is no call for revenge, it is no comfort. It is at best, "a moment of religious honesty".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The captivating poetry of Lamentations and Job <em>is</em> the work of language though. But how? One would expect that at these moments, language indeed fails us, and we fall into incomprehensible stuttering. But the opposite seems to be the case. Language is at its best in these moments, it works perfectly, and explores the fullness of its range. What is going on then? Is it, as Scholem argued, because we experience the very accusation against language in our suffering? Or is it like Job, who uses everything language got to defend his innocence?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Halbertal remarks, the author of Lamentations accepts his guilt, and laments the fact that God does not forgive us. That he even haunts us and ambushes us. Lamentations are indeed an accusation. That much the young Scholem understood. But the object of that accusation is much bigger. Only adolescents can really feel guilt, innocence, or indeed lamentation in the face of "language".</p>
